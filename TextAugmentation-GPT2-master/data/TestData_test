knowing what material your countertop is made of will make the difference.  Marble?  A non-grit buffing compound will work;  Corian? same as above, but you have to watch how hard you buff, you can remove the sheen.  Laminated? If your cuts are deep, you can use a dye material to recolor them back to the original, however, the substrata material is a non porous material so you will have to apply a genererous amount and buff it down to level.  Certain paint companies also make a self leveling two part epoxy paint that can be used to touch em up...GOOD luck! <SEP> How can I buff scratches out of my kitchen counter? Hey guys, I just had a dumb moment and I forgot to use a cutting board.  Now there are several scratches from the knife I used to chop up some celery on my kitchen counter.  I really need to know if there is a type of buffing kit I could use.  Something with a special rag and some polishing solution for kitchen counters maybe?  Has anyone had this problem before?  I want to take care of it before my room mate gets back next week, or at least before I move out in three weeks.  Something affordable would be best.  Thanks!
Most showerheads hand-screw off. My showerhead is like that. However, be careful when you unscrew it. Make sure you have a pipe wrench and clamp the pipe (where the showerhead connects to) tight. You don't want to turn or break the pipe that's sticking out of the wall. You can get teflon/plumbers tape at Home Depot. Make sure you put at least 1-2 layers of the tape around the threads in the pipe before installing the new showerhead. This will help against leaks. Again, don't forget the pipe wrench and hold the pipe while screwing in the showerhead.Here is a link I found on the DIY webpage:http://www.diynetwork.com/diy/ba_faucets_fixtures/article/0,2037,DIY_13710_2272541,00.html <SEP> How do I replace my showerhead?

I have the same engine in one of my cars. yes, there is a chip you can get however, it wont increase the power that much. However there is a bolt on turbo that fits on that engine with no modifications it was offed as a extra in your  model You can install it yourself in about 1 hour.

If the leather isn't torn or broken in any way then the finish is just worn off.You can go to several hobby supply stores and find leather dye and finish.  They may even sell a finish remover for leather as well.  If not, get some fine sandpaper and smooth out the old leather while it removes the shiny finish.  Once you are happy with how uniform the knob looks, apply the dye.  You don't need to literally soak the leather but you do need to ensure you have applied enough to penetrate evenly around the whole knob.  Follow the directions on the dye.  I believe the dyed knob should be dry before you add the finish.  I've had good luck with squeezing paper towels over the knob and soaking up all the excess while still leaving a uniform color on the knob.  Once no more dye comes off the knob, I think you are ready for the finish.  Add the finish per the directions and then hand buff with a cotton cloth and voila!  A refinished knob!  Perfect in every way... well almost... I've found it too difficult to try and add any contrasting color like some shift knobs have showing you the different gears.  If they are embossed into the leather, you will have to be careful to not sand them away.This should work well for all the leather in the interior.  Good luck! <SEP> How do you remove scuff marks from an old leather gear knob?Or at least make it look a bit better...?

Well those are some interesting answers.But anyways you need to have the unit checked by a tech-All (MOst) units will drip water. its just how the system runs. and there could be a few things wrong with yours. the defrost sensor could be bad. this would cause the unit to freeze up and not work correct. even in the winter if you have the heat on the unit will run the ac side and when it frost up it will defrost itself. and if the freon is low it could cause this.Im really shocked no one said the sensor though. I have fixed about 120units this winter and 50% plus have been the sensor and 40% freon 10% other small stuff (filter/breaker/electric panel/motor) At any rate you need to have someone come out and service the Unit. You cant do this yourself sorry to say. But with the Tech comeing out he can also go over the unit for you to avoid any other problems he spots.Goodluck <SEP> How do i stop a Central Air system from freezing up and dripping water?
There's no gap, if it uses hydraulic lifters.  Adjust with the engine running for zero lash.  You'll have to put caps on the rocker arms before starting the engine , or you'll have oil squirting everywhere :-)Alternatively - with the engine off, and in the number 1 firing position, adjust the exhaust valves for cylinders number 1, 3, 4, and 8 and the intake valves for cylinders number 1, 2, 5, and 7.Turn the valve rocker arm nut counter clockwise until the valve lash is felt in the valve pushrod.Turn the valve rocker arm nut clockwise until all the valve lash is removed. Zero valve lash can be felt by moving the valve pushrod up and down between your thumb and forefinger until there is no more up and down movement of the valve push rod.When all the valve lash is removed, then turn the valve rocker arm nut clockwise 3/4 of a turn.Turn the crankshaft clockwise 1 revolution until the alignment mark on the crankshaft balancer is aligned with the notch in the engine front cover tab.With the engine in the number 6 firing position, adjust the exhaust valves for cylinders number 2, 5, 6, and 7 and the intake valves for cylinders number 3, 4, 6, and 8.Turn the valve rocker arm nut counter clockwise until the valve lash is felt in the valve pushrod.Turn the valve rocker arm nut clockwise until all the valve lash is removed. Zero valve lash can be felt by moving the valve pushrod up and down between your thumb and forefinger until there is no more up and down movement of the valve push rod.When all the valve lash is removed, then turn the valve rocker arm nut clockwise 3/4 of a turn.If the engine won't start due to no compression when you're finished, back off each nut about 1/4 turn and try again. <SEP> How do I adjust the rocker arms on a 350 Chevy?

You probably should have put a piece of waxed paper over the hole and the cardboard on top of the waxed paper.  That way the waxed paper wouldn't stick to the plaster.  The usual method of repairing a hole in plaster board is to put a support piece behind the wallboard rather than try to get mud to hang in a hole that size and support it from the front.   You can probably just carefully tear off the cardboard, little by little and use a piece of fine sandpaper to smooth out any imperfections remaining, then paint. <SEP> How to get rid of cardboard without damaging wall or new drywall?

After the mud dries im going to need to get the cardboard out... any ideas on how to do this without destroying the new drywall?
Let's start with the basics...first of all are you positive you are referring to a manual transmission?  If so, then the answer is easy.  If not, read the owner's manual.  For an automatic transmission, park the vehicle on a level surface and engage the parking brake.  Start the engine and allow to warm up to normal operating temperature.  Raise the hood and look for the brightly colored dip stick near the firewall.  The transmission should be in park when checking fluid.   Also check the color and smell of the fluid.  Dark red to almost black is an indication of trouble and a burnt smell is another indication of problems.Now for the manual transmission.  There should be a small pipe-type plug on the side of the gear case.  Simply remove the plug.  If no oil runs out, add oil until it does.  When full, replace the plug.  Check the owner's manual for the correct lubricant, but I think I used to use the heavy rear-end oil (about 80wt).  Good luck. <SEP> How do you check standard transmission fluid levels?

Regarding the TOILET BOWL STANDING WATER AFTER A FLUSH HAS OCCURED:You might want to check to see if your overflow pipe has water running into it. Fluidmaster appropriately calls this the "refill tube."  This usually is the little hose that runs from the filler valve. Regarding the TOILET TANK WATER BEFORE A FLUSH HAS OCCURED:The float cup (or float ball) stops too low in the tank. This usually can be adjusted by adjusting the screws at the top where the arm meets the valve or for Fluidmaster units, the spring can be adjusted so that there is less room between the top of the valve and the metal spring.Check out the links below to get more information! <SEP> how to make my tolet fill up with more water? my tolet fills up i just got done fixing the rubber wahers on the tank and the bolts how can i make the water fill up more it fills up fine i just want the water a little higher? thanks
Termites need moisture from the soil to survive, so they build mud tunnels to go back and forth between the ground and your house. The tunnels also protect them from bright sunlight which they hate worse than a vampire does. So the first thing you do is simply go around the outside perimeter of your concrete foundation and scratch off any of their mud tunnels you find on the surface or in cracks at corners etc with a screwdriver or putty knife blade. They like dark crawl spaces under porches or room additions where they can get to the moist earth and build their mud tunnels straight up to the wooden floor joists. Of course any wood in direct contact with the ground is a highway to your house for them.Termites can survive in a house without having the mud tunnels going back to the ground if there's a source of water from a leaking roof or pipe etc. The worker termites are small white larvae looking things, and in the spring you'll typically see them swarming (flying) which says that they're around alright. <SEP> how do i know if there are termites in my house?

If you have a basement, or a crawl-space, you can drill screws from underneath (being careful not to use too long of a screw) through your subfloor to prevent the floorboard from moving.  This is a good cure, but, should only be used as a last resort because things can go wrong in a hurry if not done right.  Make sure you can determine how thick the plywood/subfloor under your hardwood is, and the hardwood itself, and use a considerably shorter screw then the total thickness.  You do NOT have to go into the hardwood, simply up to it so it does not move anymore.  You may have to use several screws for each spot. Have somebody up above making it squeak, it makes it alot easier to find and fix the spots.  Hope this helps, it's worked for me.

check all the fluids. the coolant should be a mid dark to mid light green, with almost a sweet odor to it. check the oil and tranni fluid. the older the fluid, the thicker it gets. for the winter time, a thinner weight oil is usually reccommended because oil thickens up at lower temps and it takes a longer time to oil the engine. a lighter oil means better start up protectionbeefy tires are needed unless you have all season tires. tire pressure should be checked at least twice a month. also, make sure to check if your heater works. <SEP> How should you prepare your car for winter?

ok there are only a few things that can cause this1st the sink can be clogged if this is the case rent a snake and run the line if you want to hire someone to do this it will run about 61 bucks for a KS line2nd To me it sounds like a vent problemThe reason for a vent is when the water is draining down the line air comes down the vent pipe behind the water to make it flow faster and to make sure it makes it too the main line. If the vent is blocked you will get a popping noise or a gur-gul sound from the drain.If there is no Vent on the line you can always install a In-Line vent or a Studer vent.To check the vent you could get on the roof with a gallon of water and pour in down the vent and listen for the flow of water if it sounds good and clear then the line has a clog or a belly in the line.Most KS Lines have alot of grease in the line and It builds up Like little mountians in the line so when the water drains it goes up and down up and down and it could make a noise like water hitting a small dam in the line. so only 2 things it could be1 Clog or small clog2 Vent Problem <SEP> How to stop a noisy drain from kitchen sink?.

first thing is go to auto zone and get about 7 quarts of tranny oil and get a new filter and gasket,then jack up the front end and then its a good idea to let it cool down first,thentake out the bolts and let it drain into a pan and after it gets all drained out,take the rest of the bolts out and drop the pan and clean off all old sealer on the pan and the tranny,now pull down the old filter and put a new o-ring on the new filter and put it in where the old filter came out of,now put the new gasket on the pan (if you want to,you can put some sealer on both sides or the gasket)and install the pan and gasket and put the bolts back in(just snug them up,dont overtighten them or you could warp the pan).now let the car back down and put in,ill say about 4 quarts of oil and start the car(let it idle)go through all the gears and then back in park,let it run and fill it until its just about a half pint low,then take it for a drive and come back and check the oil,if it needs some fill it to the full mark.i hope this helps you out. <SEP> How do you change the transmission filter on a 98 Ford Contour?

All of those answers are good ones depending on how bad (big) the leak is.If is really small (pin-hole) then the pepper idea is best.  A little bigger but still not a crack then the egg will get you to the next town (it won't help you keep the vehicle alive while you sell it though).The stop-leak additives haven't proven to me to be worth much though.  You'll spend money on them for a poor and temporary fix at best when you really need to repair the problem.Ok, this again depends on size and location of the leak.If it's leaking at a solder joint, you might be able to remove the radiator and re-solder it without spending too much money...you'll need a good work area and a torch, acid core-flux, wire-brush and some solder.  Oh, by the way, you'll need some talent too.  Working with a molten metal can be a little dangerous for the uninitiated.I'd recommend a radiator rebuild shop or a junk-yard (PC--Vehicle Salvage yard).  New radiators are really spendy and you said the vehicle wasn't worth it.Cheapest way out?Since "it is not worth spending money replacing the radiator" I have the perfect solution:Drain the radiator dry (now it won't leak any more).  Don't ever drive it again.  Have it towed (or push it) to it's final resting place.  If it's not worth a radiator, it's not worth anything. <SEP> how can I stop my car radiator from leaking?

It's now a baked in feature under the GitHub Traffic section .   You can now see detailed analytics data for repositories that you're an owner of or that you can push to. Just load up the graphs page for your particular repository and you'll see a new link to the traffic page.   The old method used to be some hack like adding an image or similar web bug to your README file.  When someone comes across your repo, provided your README has an extension that GitHub will automatically render , then it should also load the image. And that should, depending on how the web bug is set up, give you some detail or clue as to the source of traffic.  Or you could appeal via contact to the GitHub Supportocats and see if they're willing to give you a heads up on the incoming source of the sauce. <SEP> Is there any way to see traffic sources to a Github project?

First, to protect yourself from liability (not libel--that's different), hire a licensed contractor who is insured.  Ask for proof of both--he will be able to produce his current contractor's license and proof of up to date insurance and worker's comp.Second, take the time to read his contract.  If you can't understand it, spend a few dollars to have an attorney review it.Third, ask for references and call them.  It's important to understand that building and remodeling projects NEVER go as planned, so don't be surprised if all the references were disappointed in something.  But, you should focus questions on his overall character, not on the project itself.Finally, when you select a contractor, ask him some of these questions:How long do you think this project will take?What things could make it take longer?If it lasts longer, will that cost me more?Is there anything I can do to make it faster?What are some surprises you've had in the past on similar projects?How did you solve those?A good contractor will appreciate these questions, and will take the time to talk to you about them.  With this, you will have an understanding of what he's about to do, which will establish a good relationship with him.  That's just about the best protection you can get! <SEP> How do I protect myself while hiring a contractor.?

Hi Deb,Simple answer--Only way to externally identify a 440 Sixpack is to measure the counterweight thickness of the harmonic balancer....................Some spam about that,if ya wanna wade thru it >>>>A 440 Sixpack is maybe THE hardest engine to identify of all the American Hi performance engines"HP" is Hi Performance,,,and was simply stamped on enginesthat got "HP" parts bolted-in on the assembly line.No Difference in HP and HP2,none whatsoeverNo Number on the engine identifies them.Besides the 3-2bbl Intake Manifold,,there's only ONE external feature,,,and that's the Harmonic Balancer/Crankshaft Dampener thingie.Only Sixpacks had that particular dampener.Internally--the obvious & visible differences were Few also.*Pistons had 4 valve releifs in the dome,,,all other 440's had only 2*Connecting Rods-'69 part# 3462426 Casting #1851535Those were "standard 440 rods" but with extra inspection.("Magnaflux" Crack checking,I 'bleive.???)In '70 Rods were changed to Casting # 2951908These are actual "Sixpack Rods",,Sixpacks were the only engines that used them.They MIGHT be in some '69's*Camshaft Sprocket had a 3-bolt attatchment.All other 440's had One center bolt holding on the Cam Gear.Obviously,,in order to VERIFY any of those things means WRENCH WORK,,Remove Cylinder Heads,or Oil Pan,or Timing Cover.........................................................Identifying the Balancer is easiest.It has 2 distinguishing features:#1 It has the ol' Offset Bolt Pulley---One of the bolts which holds the Pulley to the Balancer is Offset,,so that the Pulley will only install in That certain position.(which makes NO difference anyway???)The Offset Bolt Hole is the one which is aligned with the Timing Mark on the Balancer.There's a LATER 440 Balancer that looks VERY SIMILAR,except it's got a LITTLE Thicker Counterweight & All the Bolt Holes are the same--pulley will install in any position.It can be "tricky" to the eye to tell the 440 balancer from the SIXPACK one.#2) Sixpack has the Thinnest of all the counterweights,,among Mopar's counterweighted balancers.The Weight is .20" Thick on a SixPack,,and its .25" on the one that "looks like a Sixpack"The Sixpack is a little over 3/16",The Other is a little over 1/4"That's a Small Difference,,,,.050" ,,about  1.25 mm or 1/16"Easiest way to measure it without taking the Pulley Off:Get a 3/16" and 1/4"  Drill Bit,,a Good Light,,,and crawl under the car.Try them in the gap between the Pulley and the Balancer."Eyeball" Each bit's thickness in comparrison to the Thickness of the COUNTERWIEGHT.(Using the Straight end/SmoothShank part of the Bit,,,right? :)It makes like a "feeler gauge",,and the Difference will be obvious to see if you get a good close look at the Balancer.Here's an Ugly Old picture to see the Counterweight.Sorry it's not nice,,,Pics are SCARCE.At least the Counterweight is Clear and Obvious.On the page,,the 1st pair of Rusty looking balancers---Notice the one on the LEFT looks even & symmetricalon it's face,,surrounding the bolt holes.The one on the RIGHT is "LIKE" the Sixpack's.It has the Eccentric,Crescent Shaped Counterweight on it's face,In that pic,,the Weight is a thin ring on the Bottom,and it's Thick/Wide at the top.I hope I explained that to make any sense,,it's pretty obvious to see.http://www.moparts.com/Tech/Archive/bb/22.htmlI'd suggest using the "drill bit thickness gauge"in an area where the Weight's Diameter is Larger,,,such as from about 9 O'clock to 3:00 in that Pic.It will be easier to See the Thickness at the shallower De <SEP> How do you identify a 6 pack 440 motor?

assuming the cooling system is being refilled after service-fill part way and start engine with the heater on and blower fan on low speed-continue to fill with 50/50 mixture of coolant and distilled water until the thermostat opens-generally around 180-195 degrees-besure to leave the cooling system cap off until all the air has purged from the system through the cap opening-its normally through purging soon after the thermostat opens and the cooling fans engage-dont be alarmed if some coolant bubbles out during the process-also....make sure the engine does'nt overheat during the purging process-which can happen if air gets trapped at the thermostat-just switch off the vehicle and allow to cool,then try again.............good luck! <SEP> how do you bleed the coolant lines on a 1996 chevy cavalier 2.2L engine?

The professional way is to remove the old trim and replace it. You say you will be patching anyway, so removing the trim shouldn't be a problem.

I do not know where you live where you can leave the windows open all the time.  I have to assume perhaps the islands.  I live on the ocean and battle the salt daily.

I feel it has to do with who views your page, for how long, who you view, for how long,  and how frequently you search them. Your friends probably has a somewhat large value to show up first and/or their friends and the value can probably be lowered than a non-friend due to the time factor spent on a non-friend's page. Maybe even clicks is played into the search. There is a complicated formula. Facebook is crazy about this stuff. In the movie, when Mark (facebook CEO) did the site about which girl at school was hot or not, he ask a friend to come up with a formula to determine a winner.

I liked this guy and I couldn't find his page. Of course he was searching me as well and I'm assuming the reason why I was unable to search him was because he made his page only searchable to friends.

I am assuming you have laminate on plywood or MDF that you want to salvage discarding only the laminate.If the old laminate is loose due to bad contact cement application. initially it might be easy. Otherwise a lot of scraping is in your future.The hardest part is to get off the old laminate and any cement underneath it. If it is loose try sliding a paint scraper under it and prying up gradually. If not tap the scraper under the edging and try to get that off first with prying. Then start on the top sheet of laminate and slip the scraper under it and pry it. Repeat until all the laminate is off. Next look at the cement left on the plywood surface. Clean it off with a sanding block of about 200 grit.When cement is gone and laminate is in the dumpster, just get the new laminate, new contact cement, roller, some newspapers, and  either a router or a laminate trimmer. Just follow the application directions for the new laminate (with the most important being that wherever you put it down it is going to want to stick). <SEP> How do you Re-Laminate kitchen countertops?

If youre talking about a chrome panel on the lower side of the door,you would first remove it by prying from the door.Perhaps a razor knife on the edge to get it started and then use an adheisive remover (goo-gone) to satuarate the underside of the old panel as it peels away.If it isnt a chrome metal panel then it may be a chrome tape type of panel.In either case,the adheisive remover will get things rolling.Scrape the remaining glue or residue on the door and clean it real good.When you add the new chrome piece it will most likely have an adheisive backing that you peel and stick.Its a good idea to line up the new piece exactly where you want it and mark it with a pencil before removing the backing.That way there are no mistakes because once its on,its on.

Actually, one gallon will not do much for your well.What you do, is add a gallon to your well, and wait 15 minutes.  Run your pump, until you take out all the water in your water holding tank, and replace it with the water in the well.Take a regular chlorine testing kit for a pool, and test your water, to see if it has any residual of chlorine.If you dont have any, then put another gallon down the well, and repeat this process...When you have a 1.0 mg/l residual after 15 minutes, then run your water holding tank out again, and test after 30 minutes.  (Also, open all the spigots in the house, and let the chlorinated water flow out of each of them, so that the chlorine will kill any bacteria in there as well.I estimate you will probably use 3-5 or more gallon or chlorine for your well, maybe more, maybe less, it depends on how much water you have in the well.Now, if you have a reading of 2.5 mg/l or less, IT IS SAFE TO DRINK!!My City, the City of Steubenville, Ohio, keeps a 2.5 mg/. residual of chlorine in our city water at ALL TIMES!!  (Aint it something, that 2.0 mg/l will kill fish, but we have more chlorine in our water than that!! :)...So, do not be alarmed if you do end up with a high cl2 (chlorox or chlorine) reading.Like I say, I would run it through all the lines in your house, and those outside your house, to kill all bacteria in the lines also.Also, chlorox only has 4% of chlorine by volume so, it acuatlly isnt that powerful as the two ton cylinders I was used to moving around that was straight chlorine! And that we use for the Water Filtration Plant--> Water Treatment Plant.How do I know this?I am a Ohio Class III Waste Water Plant Operator with 27 years experience, and I recently retired from the City of Steubenville.

Gmail backups have become a somewhat timely topic, as thousands of Gmail users had their account reseted by accident recently.

First,since you rent,there may be a clause in your rental agreement that does not allow for these appliances in your apartment.This can be solved by simply asking the landlord of the apartment complex.If this is the case,the point is mute.If this is not the case then have them do the work or have it done by an electrician. The reason I say this is that installing a 220V outlet for a dryer most likely involves more work than you want to do yourself....cutting into the wall,getting wire in the wall,wiring the outlet and the breaker panel,installing a dedicated breaker,repairing the wall,and don't forget the dryer has to be vented,etc..If you are allowed to have a dryer in the apartment,you might try finding a 110V portable unit that you can simply plug into an existing outlet.Hope this helps. <SEP> How do I hook up ap an electric dryer?? I moved into my apartment and there are no gas or electric outlets or hook-ups for my dryer.

It's not like I can take my dryer hookup with me when I decide to move out. So it's like a waste of money!! Any suggestions??Please Be detailed.

Intake  0.008 in Exhaust  0.010 in  This is with the piston in the firing position, rockers off the cam lobe.It is highly unlikely that the lash adjustment has anything to do with the cylinder not firing (dead cylinder). It is possible that having no lash would cause it, but that is not apt to occurr on it's own. It is possible that you now have the valves set "too tight".I would suspect the real problem to be a burnt exhaust valve assuming of course there was spark at the wire, and the plug is good. Swap plugs, and wires with #3 cylinder. If miss is still on #4, and there is valve lash, do a compression test. I bet it will be low. <SEP> How do you adjust the valves and rockers in a '95 Mitsubishi Mirage 1.5 lire? First off, I'm not a mechanic.  Know just enough to be dangerous and don't mind admitting it.  #4 cylinder in my daughters car was dead (pull plug wire and makes no difference in the rpms).  Decided I was going to take off the valve cover and check the valves and rockers.  I thought they had alot of play in them, more than the others.  While I was getting the tools out, a friend bumped the ignition and changed location of the valves.  I adjusted it like whenIi checked the first time.  Car  would not start.  Adjusted back to where I tyhought they had been.  Got it to start again, but either dies or almost dies when you put it in gear.  What is the spacing on the rockers when the cylinder is open?  Any ideas why the cylinder could be dead?  New plugs, wires, cap and rotor.  Tried turning distributor also.  No difference.  But need to get it back to where it can be driven at least.  Any info on the valves would be appreciated.  Thanks.

The rules for home refinance are much simplier and easier than the original loan.

The halogen is made such that the actual lamp is inside the surrounding reflector. The lamp has two prongs portruding from the reflector that fit tightly into a "free" base, in that the base is not really secured to anything other than the lamp, and the lamp is typically held by the trim. This is a little different than landscape lighting where the base us usually secured to a  mount.Let them completely cool off, get the lamp out of the trim piece then work one side of the base up a little (nearest one of the two pins), then the opposite side, "wiggling" the lamp slowly out of the base. If it absolutely does not move, the flimsy little base may get bent up trying to force everything, these are easy to replace if they get totally wrecked and you can buy them at any electrical supply house. Once in awhile one or both of the pins break off in the hole, a good pair of needle nose pliers may get them out.If you end up replacing the base, use high temperature rated wire nuts to attach the new leads to the old leads. Make sure you do not use lamps with a wattage greater then the fixture is rated for, often 50 watts. There are soome 70 watt maximum and there are some trim pieces that will force a maximum of 35 watts, such as shower trims. Too high a wattage may damage fixtures and/or cause fires. <SEP> How do you change the small down lights used in kitchens etc.?

Don't call me gave one of the best answers..... I work on these all the time... wash it out with dawn dishliquid and warm water. Wrench it out good and let dry for a day or two, then oil it, make sure it gets throughout the filter, then squeeze it out good, reinstall it... start the engine, ( it will smoke some, depending on how well you got the oil out)... if your in a hurry, pour gas through it, wrench it out, reoil like above and install.... DO replace it once a year, no more then 2 years... clean it often in dusty conditions... Though I would like to say, soap and water is cheaper then wasting that gas now...., both do well though..

Super glue won't work.

Designed for laundry, it comes in a green bottle and takes off almost anything -- even my daughter's dried oil paint without destroying her clothes or brushes and wood beam sap from a grand piano without harming the finish.   Depending on the adhesive, you can also try nail polish remover, alcohol, and olive oil.  Then use Soilove to remove the oil stain. <SEP> How can I remove advesive from an automobile headliner?

You don't have to remove the whole rack. Remove the wheel. Undo the tie rod end and leave the nut on 6 or 7 threads. Take a heavy hammer and strike the eye of the ball pin several times to release the taper.(this is why you left the nut on so if the hammer missed it would not damage the ball pin threads) Now, lift the tie rod end out of the steering arm and undo the adjusting lock nut on the tie rod end and screw it off, noting the number of turns, also remove the lock nut. R & R the new boot and refit the lock nut and tie rod end the same number of turns,(this avoids a wheel alighnment) tighten the locknut and refit the tie rod end to the steering arm and replacee the wheel.

The accurate answer is that you cannot.  There are various methods whereby you can make the process of copying contacts from one account to another, but that requires you to copy them, and then delete them on the old account.

air pressure holds the brakes in the "off" position. when you apply the brakes, air is released from the system causing the shoes to close. if for some reason the system develops a leak, the brakes will engage and lock up. that's why you have to let the air pressure build up in a rig before releasing the parking brake, no air pressure means no brake release. <SEP> how do air brakes work?

A refrigerator that is that old, probably needs to have it's rubber seal that runs around the door replaced..Also check to make sure your refrigerator is level..If the rubber seal is worn out,it will cause your refrigerator motor to run more than usual and leak. <SEP> How Do You Fix The Suction, On A Refrigerator Door So It Stays Shut? The refrigerator is split vertically down the center.  On the right side is one full-length refrigerator door.  On the left side are two half-size freezer doors (top & bottom) separated by a center ice/water dispenser.The unit is about 15 years old and a few months ago the full-length refrigerator door lost its suction, which now inhibits the door from staying securely shut.Any significant movement to the unit—like the opening and closing of the other two freezer doors—causes the refrigerator door to open about ½ inch.  This in turn produces condensation, which makes a puddle and then leaks through the floor.I looked over all hinges and mechanisms—I also cleaned the unit thoroughly, but I have yet to find the problem.  Any ideas what caused this or how I can fix it?

I am not sure if you can get the door open without damaging the hinges.

OK, take the middle pin out of the middle hinge. Now, you need a hammer. Lay each end of the pin on separate blocks. Now, hit the center of the pin very soft but hard enough to make it bend a little. not to much. OK. This will bend the pin a little. Now, put back the pin back from where you got it.

I assume you have an electric water heater. If so I suspect one of the elements is burned out or one of the thermostats is bad. Electric water heaters have two thermostats and two heating elements. If one of the elements burns out or one of the thermostats quits working you don't get enough hot water.But first connect a hose to the outlet at the bottom of the tank and run water out of it for 10 minutes. See if clearing the sediment helps. Sometimes sediment keeps the bottom element from working right. If it doesn't help then it is either a thermostat or heating element in which case you should call a service man and have it repaired. <SEP> How to make the hot water last longer?

A handy man had come over, and he said and switch the temperature of the hot water hotter (he did it at the hot water production machine located at the laundry room), that's all he can do. But switching the hot water temperature hotter doesn't help make hot water last longer.I thought it was just me taking shower too long, but I ask my friend, and she said she took very long and hot water still did not run out.How to make hot water don't run out so quickly? Especially in winter, it runs out more quickly.

If you've had new brake pads fitted, they can squeak while they are bedding in -- especially if they are sintered metal pads. This is normal and don't worry about it; the squeal will go away pretty soon when the pads are fully bedded in. (With race cars, they bed in several sets of pads during practice, and then they use the bedded in sets during a race. Not because they're worried about squeal but because bedded pads give slightly better performance -- and also they will know if any are duds that might disintegrate under full braking load. It happens...)You can fit ceramic-compound pads if you want. This will reduce the squeal.If you haven't had the brakes done for a while and they're squeaking really loud, most likely you have pads worn down to the metal and they're rubbing on the disk rotors. This is very bad news, because you are ruining the rotors and they're expensive -- and also the car won't stop as well as it should (until, that is, the things overheat and weld the pads to the rotors). You can also crack and/or warp the rotors if your pads are shot. The pads help to absorb heat and if they're too thin, the rotors get too hot.Take a look and see if you've still got brake material on the pads. If not, get them changed pronto (and probably the rotors will need to be machined as well). Always change both sides (ie both wheels) at the same time, even if one side is more worn than the others. This will keep your car's braking in balance.If you still have pads, they and/or the rotors have probably 'glazed'. They can be cleaned with special spray you can buy from any good auto accessories shop. DO NOT use gasoline to clean brakes, okay? Use only specialized brake cleaner.Check out the problem pronto or you may have a wreck. Seriously. <SEP> How to stop 1997 grand voyager squeaky brakes?

Long-term solution:1. Caulk the outside window frame, where it meets the house. Caulk all joints and seams in the outside of the window.2. Check the glazing compound inside and out to be sure it is attached to both the glass and frame.3. Caulk the inside joint around the window where it meets the wall. 4. Seal any cracks or seams in the non-moving parts of the window and sashes. 5. Use a weatherseal (I like V-Seal) to line the sides and bottom of the moving sashe, and the joint between the two sashes.That gives you a weather-tight window that will last a long time (depending at least in part on the quality of the caulks and materials), AND saves money in the summer as well.Additional insulation can be provided by outside mounted plastic sheeting, inside mounted shrink film plastic, good curtains, etc. <SEP> how to stop cold air from coming from windows that wasn't properly sealed to keep out air?

Your problem is the main drain and NOT the P-Trap. If it was only the P-trap then the neighbor wouldn't be having a problem. Both your drains may meet behind the wall before they go into the drain pipe. If that's the case there may be a problem behind the wall and that is the landlords problem. Unless you want what you dropped down I wouldn't worry about taking apart your p-trap. The landlord should send someone to the roof to drop a snake down the drain vent and remove the clog. Should you want to remove the p-trap you will need an adjustable wrench to remove the two nuts that hold it in place. You may want to go to a home store or plumbers shop and buy another p-trap if it looks nasty because it might fall apart when you try to remove the nuts. You will need an 11/2" for the kitchen and 1 1/4 for a bathroom. BE AWARE THAT WHEN YOU REMOVE IT ALL THE WATER THAT IS BACKED UP INTO THE DRAIN PIPE IS GOING TO START GUSHING OUT OF THE PIPE.

I have dropped a couple of items down my drain & My landlord's worker tried to fix it a couple of years ago but did'nt succeed. I have been able to plunge it  when it stops draining but now it has gotten worse. I live upstairs & the lady in  the apt. next to me is having problems with hers also, (I assuume because we share a common pipe, which is past our seperate drains. According to our leases we are responsible for the plumbing bill if we caused the problem!! Neither she nor I can afford large plumbing expense.  I was told by a friend that since the trap is metal (galvinized) it would be easy to repacel due to the fact that it is not only clogged but  also probably quite corroded.  She informed me that it  not a difficutl task  you just must use caution !!I understand, with that said, her son was going to try to use a "Shop Vac" & plastic tubing to try to suck out the objects down there. but I don't know if that would be sufficient ,because I believe some has gone past the trap!!!

The process for adding bibliographic data is   (Enter the references into the reference management of your choice.)  For every title you want to cite, insert the corresponding placeholder string into the Google Docs document. An example for such a placeholder would be {Baeza-Yates 1997 #3}. The reference management software will usually allow to copy the placeholder string for a chosen title to clipboard.  With all the placeholders entered into the document, export it as .rtf file.  Feed the .rtf file into the reference management software. Out will come a .rtf file with all the placeholders replaced by citations (in the style chosen) and a trailing list of citations.   ... or use WizFolio web service (http://wizfolio.com/) <SEP> Adding bibliographic references to a Google Docs document?

Most carpet cleaners are little more than a little soap and water sold in fancy packages.  You will find purified water has tremendous cleaning power on its own.  I would suggest you try it alone for most fresh stains with a white paper towel.1) blot the stain or dirty area when fresh and remove as much of the stain with the paper towel.  Continue until the paper towel comes away clean even if the stain remains.2) Wet the area lightly and continue the process, until the paper towel comes away clean or the stain is gone.3) Mild soap and water with the clean paper towel.If you cannot get the stain out there is a tool called a cookie cutter that can patch an area of carpet.  Take carpet out of the closet corner (where it can't be seen) and replace it in the cookie cut area.  You are swapping the areas and most anyone can do this. <SEP> How to make a homemade carpet cleaner that really works?
You have to be careful to not be too rough, or you will scratch the porcelin of the toilet bowl.

You have to install some type of cold air return as suggested above. if you put in a simple floor vent your problem will be solved. you should place one vent in each room you want heated although not completely necessary this will be the best way to get the heat around. The vents will work one of two ways either the heat will come up the stair case and go into the rooms you want to heat while the cold are returns to the basement through the vent or (and more likely) the heat will rise up through the vents and the cold air will return to the basement through the stair way.

hi sato...test the mix of epoxy? that could be a little difficult.  most manufacturers will supply 2 component epoxies as a kit with the proper ratio of "a" (epoxy paint) to "b" (hardener or catalyst)...there are literally dozens of epoxy types on the market (polyamide cure, polyamine cure, acrylic epoxy, etc) and many of them are now available in both a solvent-borne and water-borne solution.  each of these different epoxies may require a different ratio of part a to part b...most of the solvent-borne polyamide cures (standard workhorse of epoxy coatings) are a 1:1 mix and an induction time of 30-60 minutes is often required before applying converted product - and pot life is usually 8-12 hours before converted product should be discarded.   contrast that to a water-borne acrylic epoxy that may have a 16:1 mix with no induction time and a pot life of 24 hours.each epoxy product has different characteristics and usually recommended for different types of application from swimming pools to industrial floors to surfaces exposed to solvent splash and extreme moisture...i think the key here is to find a contractor that has experience in the application of epoxy coatings and has the knowledge to direct  you to the proper coating for your needs (a contractor will save no money or labor by cheating on the mixture of epoxy but can create a mess if the product is not converted properly)...also, get to know your local independent paint store dealer - he/she can provide you with a ton of information (application, technical, surface preparation, disposal, etc.) on these high performance coatings...i hope this info is helpful to you...good luck on your projectsric <SEP> How do i test the mix of my epoxy coating?

Hey, this is just my type of question.  I am called the Princess of Plumbing in my town and my suggestion to callers when they call in with this situation is to get a pail of water and pour it down each floor drain.

Try this before you hire a plumber. <SEP> HOw do I get rid of a Sewer smell that comes after the upstairs toilet is flushed.?

Well since you live in a Apartment building The only thing you can really do is Pull back the carpet And Mark the floor joist with a chalk lineThen use 2 1/2 deck locking screws every 6 inches or so This will pull the flooring down to the studs. also If any nails are sticking up hammer them in. This is the best way to fix this problem since you in a apartment. If you lived in a house and had a basement you could fix it from the bottom. since this is not the case this is all you can do. Call a carpet guy out to pull back the carpet off the tack strip (or do that yourself) do this to the floor and Call the Carpet guy back to kick the carpet back into place. Try to do this when the person you live above or below is not home it will make some noise. The carpet guy wont cost much.Also where you hear the noise start there with the screws after you put in 30 or so walk the floor untill the noise is gone. after the noise is gone put a screw in every 12 to 16 inches past the part where the noise stopped. this will make sure the noise did not travel and will slao stop it from moving down the hall or somewhere else..Happy screwing..LOLI had to write back to this ? and the 1 answer You dont want to cut the carpet If you do this the landlord can make you pay for new carpet. @nd make sure you find the joist if you do not find them and you drive a 3 inch screw into the floor and no joist you could hit a water line or elec. <SEP> How can  I stop the wood in my floor, under my carpet, from squeaking?

If the flooring is new and not worn then you may have soap build up which can dull hard floor finishes.  Mopping is fine only if you are using a wood floor mop.  They can be found in any hardware store, Wal-mart etc.  They are a flat version of a mop and use less water.  you should never use excess water on wood floors.  I have seen many wood floors damaged this way.  You could try to rinse with just plain water to remove build up or use water with some white vinegar (vinegar is acidic and an effective way to rinse soap build up & a good home remedy) you can also buy a store bought rinsing agent which would be a higher grade acidic cleaner.  If your floor is dull due to wear there are some products you can buy off the shelf to restore wood floors that are inexpensive but they are really just short term solutions, they usualy are a wax of some kind.  The best way to get the shine back of a worn wood floor is to sand and re-finish.  Which is best left to a pro unless you are very handy (then you can rent everything nessesary at most hardware stores).As for on going maintenance for hard floors, do not use excess soap and only use a neutral soap, better yet clean often using only water or very little soap.

If I understand the question, you want to know what the problem may be when the problem IS NOT that the system is undercharged? If the system is fully charged is your compressor cycling? If not, do you have power to the compressor? The system may have enough charge but if the pressures on the high side and the low side are not right the system will not operate properly. If the high side pressure is too high there is probably a restriction and a high pressure switch will shut the compressor off to prevent more pressure from building up.

Your charge will depend on a number of factors.  First, determine the ambient temperature outside.  Then, put a thermometer on the suction line, the bigger of the two pipes on your outside condenser.  Watch the temp of the suction line as you charge the unit.  At 95 degress outside with 68psi of freon on your low side (big pipe) you should have a line temp of 43 - 45 degrees.  Then check the temperature of the air coming out of the vent closest to your a/c inside your home.  Proper outlet temp will be 55-57 degrees.  Do not charge more than 75psi of freon.  This will cause your a/c to not properly change from vapor to liquid to vapor in the cycle.A/C is a tricky  and time-consuming proposition.  If nothing else, hook your blue hose up to the large line Schrader valve (looks like a tire valve) on the outside unit.  Charge it to 70psi and WAIT.  Keep checking the large line temp and the inside vent temp til you get 43-45 degrees outside on the line and 55-59 degrees inside.  Do not over-charge the freon.  As your unit balances the freon in liquid and vapor forms, the pressure will drop, so be patient and use temperature to achieve maximum cooling efficiency.  Stick with 68 - 7O psi on the low-side (large line) on the outside unit if nothing else.  And let it run to allow it to properly balance out the freon.If you get confused, call a tech.

On some vehicles the AC compressor can be bypassed, or removed and then you use a serpentine belt for a non AC vehicle. Some vehicles have to have an idler added to it. I am not sure if the 4.3 Astro would need the idler or not.My local parts supplier has AC eliminator kits they can order, you can probably find one locally. It may be just as cheap to find a "junkyard" compressor and swap it out with yours and not re-charge the air.

You said vinyl floor right, well don't use thinner, it will breakdown the vinyl and make it rubbery. Hopefully you still have a glossy shine to your floor, that makes it so the paint cannot bond with the floor very well. Wet the area with water, then using a spray bottle, mist the paint with rubbing alcohol (80% or greater). It will react with the paint but not the floor causing a chemical reaction with the latex in the paint, making the latex rubberize. You can the use an ice scraper to remove the paint. it should peel right off the floor with a little elbow grease. <SEP> How do I remove paint from vinyl floor?

Hard to say without seeing the installation.  Check if sink faucet flow is strong (if not main valve to house or apartment may be partially closed and should be wide open - should check it open anyway).  To check that a valve is open you should be able to turn it a couple turns shut then open it all the way.   If flow is weak do you use a well pump or city water?  If system has low pressure you may not be able to block flow from a sink faucet with thumb pressure (I can stop water flow at my camp using my thumb but not at my house on city water which is probably about 80 psi.  If you have a city water pressure problem, neighbors should have the same problem.  Next, see if there are valves available that isolate only the tub for repairs (if there are any these should be wide open).  Next, is flow weak for both hot and cold water?  Each line would have its own isolation valve if provided.  If flow is weak for both hot and cold water, and there is a diverter valve in the tub faucet for a shower head, the diverter may be jammed due to mineral buildup or corrosion and may be blocking flow.  That may require a plumber or a handyman.  Do the hot and cold valves oof the tub faucet require the same number of turns to full open?  They should be about the same or one may be installed wrong.  Good luck. <SEP> How do I get more water flow through my tub spout? When I go to take a bath, the water flow in my tub is next to none. It takes about an hour to fill up. Any suggestions?

Carbine ? Carbon maybe?Carbon build up is normal / at least at some levels.The only real way to remove the carbon from inside the motor is to take it apart - there are cleaners that are supposed to work but I have never (in my 20+ years) seen one that works worth the money you pay for them.Carbon will be reduced with a good tune up (not those cheap 29.99 tune ups at the local quick shop but a GOOD one)If a shop told you about this, check with another shop about it. <SEP> How do I clean Carbine off my 1989 Mercury Marq.?

I used to be a Tin Man...I know how to answer this.  Getting a number of estimates is a good idea, as the person above suggests.However...knowing your own budget and the value of the service you desire in advance of getting estimates is the most powerful way to control the circumstances.Try these steps:1. Make sure your contractor has a few jobs under his belt.  Its not that I want to dissuede a talented company from getting a start, but you need to know that they can complete a job.  Obviously the longer they have been around the better.2. Naturally check their reputation out with the Better Business Bureau (if you live in the U.S.)3. Here is the strongest point:Know the value of the labor and materials you want to put into the project.  Here's how: - In today's world you can take your sketches to any Home Depot, Lowes and most high end consumer home improvement stores and get them to estimate the materials needed to go into your job.Lets say you are working on a new single car garage.  Altogether Home Depot estimates your cost for a 24 x 24 single car garage to be around $6500.00.  That doesnt include getting the slab dug and poured or the labor to build it.If you have three contractors come in with prices ranging from $12,000 - $25,000 and you know the materials would only cost $6500, FIRST - you need to know what each one is giving you...and then start looking at why the high price is so high.  If its high because they are giving you more, then have them re-bid it WITHOUT the extras.  If its high for no other reason then they are trying to make too much money off of YOU... - Basically, if you know the materials and someone can help you figure out what the labor would cost, then YOU tell the contractor what YOU can afford and DO NOT SWAY FROM IT.So here's how I do it know.  I know I've got a project to build that costs $5,000 in materials.  I figure out that the labor is usually 2/3 of the estimate, so I do my own estimate (more of a guestimate sure) which comes out at $15,000.  THEN I insure that I can afford that cost.THEN I get the estimates.  Whoever has the best experience, best reputation and comes closest to my budgeted number is the contractor I would choose.4. DO NOT close on your deal on the same day the salesman calls on you.  There are some HARDCORE closers out there who MIGHT actually represent good companies, but are only out to line their own pockets with your money with a quick sale.  The background language they use for a person who buys on the same day is a "mooch" - which means you are an easy mark to jack up the price and get a financed sale the same night.  Mooches DO NOT know what things cost.  They don't know materials, they don't know labor and they will sign without reading the contract all the way through.Take a day to read all the proposals - MAKE SURE there is language in the contract that protects YOU the consumer.If you do sign, DON'T FORGET - you have a THREE DAY RIGHT OF RECISION - in most or all states of the US.  Meaning that the contract isn't even VALID until 72 hours AFTER you signed it.Some of the old school tin men I worked for used to "spike" the job.  That means that EVEN THOUGH the recision time wasn't up, they would pull a building permit and put it in the customers window to distract the customer from considering a contract cancellation.Watch for strange behaviors like that.One more thing I remember from my experience.If a salesman calls back to the main office having a "discussion" with the home office, it MIGHT be real...OR...he is having a fake conversation (even if its a pretend one with his boss) where they talk about "saving you money" with some materials they have "left over".  This is UTTER BULLSH*T.  The price has already been jacked up and they are allowing you to feel a sense of false victory in "talki <SEP> how do i not get cheated by a home contractor?

Cleaning Bronze FAQBronze is copper alloy. In modern times, bronze is an alloy of copper and any metal except zinc. It is generally more expensive than brass and more corrosion resistant. Bronze forms a patina (green color) which is protective to the metal and is often seen on artwork. Reproduced it is called Verde. Bronze will deteriorate rapidly if exposed to moisture and chlorides or sulfides.Solid bronze often is lacquered (at the factory) to protect the finish. Lacquered bronze only needs dusting and an occasional wiping with a damp cloth. Have the lacquer replaced if it cracks or peels.Keep bronze pieces as clean as possible. Accumulations of dust and dirt can eat into the metal surface. Dust regularly using a soft cloth. Do not rub too vigorously, especially on any protruding parts. If a bronze piece has been neglected for a long time and is covered with grime, thoroughly clean it with a soft brush. Remove all dust from crevices and notches and then lightly rub the entire surface with a soft flannel cloth. For a more thorough cleaning, carefully wash with a solution of 1 tablespoon of salt and 3 1/2 quarts of water. Rinse well. Polish with copper polish followed by glass wax.  If you want a high polish, dip a cloth into liquid wax and apply to the piece. When dry, buff lightly to a high gloss. This wax treatment also may be given to bronze pieces that are kept outdoors. Weathered bronze usually darkens; however, this is natural and does not harm the piece."Bronze disease" is one of the most serious hazards of bronze. This disease, caused when chlorides and oxygen combine in a damp environment, also attacks brass and pewter. The disease takes the form of a sudden outbreak of small patches of corrosion and is distinguished by rough, light green spots. "Bronze disease" usually can be stopped by washing the piece in repeated changes of boiling hot, distilled water. You may have to soak the object for a week or more in distilled water. If this treatment does not work, consult a museum expert about using a strong solution of sodium sesqui-carbonate or have your piece treated by a professional.General Purpose Bronze Cleaner: Salt, Vinegar, and Flour. Dissolve 1 teaspoon salt in 1 cup white vinegar. Add enough flour to make a paste. Apply paste to bronze and let sit for 15 minutes to 1 hour. Rinse with clean, warm water, and polish dry. <SEP> how do you remove wax from bronze? my mom has a candle holder and the wax from the candle dripped and hardened on it.

I think you are talking about what to do for the wood on the bottom of the cabinet.  First, make sure you get the plumbing repaired first.  Simply replace the drain pipes under the sink.  I recommend replacing everything.

Cut a piece of plywood that fits inside the cabinet.  Set the plywood on the lip that you left when you cut the old base out.

The heater core is like a mini radiator which is mounted on the firewall in front of the passenger footwell.  On a GM truck body it's usually mounted inside the cab with 2 brass/alloy tubes running through the firewall and into the engine compartment.

Since the OP specifically says:   It doesn't have to use ASCII (it can be Unicode)   I thought I'd share the link for the (mysql / unicode / html) table generator created by a SE user for use on SE I found on superuser . I found it quite useful to get unicode tables (which I sometimes prefer over the Windows-1252 compatible "ASCII" art). And this tool lets you compare the outputs, as well as getting a HTML formatted table, too.  Example to show my workflow: I'm making a web app for my bookkeeper to calculate sales tax and I am doing math on months and quarters so that the tool always automatically displays "last quarter's sales tax info" . Since  I'm always thinking of arrays starting with 0, I needed to embed a simple table outlining the months in each quarter to keep the values sorted in my head.  1) To get the table started, I used this generator (listed on both this and the other QA) with its Excel-like input interface to actually create the data, as the unicode tool wants pre-formatted text. I type in the values then select them and CTRL-C to get my tab delimited table:  Quarter Numbers Names Q1  1, 2, 3 Jan, Feb, Mar Q2  4, 5, 6 Apr, May, Jun Q3  7, 8, 9 Jul, Aug, Sep Q4  10, 11, 12  Oct, Nov, Dec  2) went to senseful's generator and pasted into the input area. I played with each of the 3 options and I liked the Unicode Art option the best:  ╔═════════╦════════════╦═══════════════╗ ║ Quarter ║  Numbers   ║     Names     ║ ╠═════════╬════════════╬═══════════════╣ ║ Q1      ║ 1, 2, 3    ║ Jan, Feb, Mar ║ ║ Q2      ║ 4, 5, 6    ║ Apr, May, Jun ║ ║ Q3      ║ 7, 8, 9    ║ Jul, Aug, Sep ║ ║ Q4      ║ 10, 11, 12 ║ Oct, Nov, Dec ║ ╚═════════╩════════════╩═══════════════╝  Note that for the table to show up correctly on a web page, the character set must be specifically set for UTF-8:  <meta content='text/html; charset=UTF-8' http-equiv='Content-Type'/> <SEP> Is there a webapp to create ASCII art tables?

Jene is correct – “If you can feel the scratch with your finger nail it is too deep to be buffed out” An alternative to a regular body shop is a mobile service called AERO-COLOURS.

Disassemble the door’s handle and lock by first removing the screws on the side of the handle and sliding out the mechanism.2. Reattach the damaged veneer and cracked areas of door by mixing up epoxy and filling the cracks using a tongue depressor.3. Place a piece of wax paper over the area and secure the damaged door with a woodworking clamp while the epoxy hardens.4. Since the original opening for the lock mechanism was incorrectly cut, you'll need to use a section of dowel to fill the opening so you can start over.5. Pick a dowel of the appropriate diameter and cut about a 4-inch section. Score grooves along the length of the dowel piece to give the epoxy something to bond to. A good way to do this is by clamping a handsaw upright on a workbench and carefully dragging the dowel across the teeth of the saw.  6. Mix wood epoxy and spread along half of the dowel. Insert dowel into lock hole. Apply the woodworking clamp again while epoxy hardens, about 30 minutes.7. Cut away any excess dowel with a pull saw. Cut as close as possible to door without damaging it. Fill all remaining depressions with adhesive filler.8. Smooth down the area with a rasp followed by sandpaper.9. Drill new hole through dowel for lock using a paddle bit. Orient the doorknob and mark the edge of the mortise while holding the lock plate in position on the door edge.10. Score out the cut for the mortise using a utility knife. Make sure to stay inside the lines you drew.11. Chisel out a mortise, about 1/8-inch deep, using a chisel and hammer.12. Pre-drill holes for mounting lock plate and attach with screws. Reassemble doorknob mechanism and re-hang door. <SEP> How do I fix a stuck doorknob? My front door will not open.

Okay. Removing door panels isnt too different for any car. Make sure the window is down before you start. It will make it easier to get it off. There is probably a screw on th bottomside of the arm rest (or pull handle) What you use to pull the door shut.   Probably one in the trim around the handle to open the door. You'll want to get a door trim removal tool and pry the panel off starting in the corner. when you get an idea of where the clips are that are holding the panel to the door shell, start pryin in these spots along the bottom and up the sides of the door panel. When you get all thoses, lift the door panel UP. it is hooked to the door at the top by the window.when you get it off the shell, unplug the wires etc.. and VOILA! you should be done. This is a general description for pretty much any car so you might have a few more screws, or things to unhook, but this should help. <SEP> how do you remove f350 door panel?

Most cracks in an aluminum head are fairly easy to see with the naked eye, if you have some experience. Your head can't be magnafluxed, it's aluminum and doesn't magnatize.

First. do you have a warranty (just take it back). Second. do you have a lot of time. What you got to do first is check weather its the bulb (different wattages will mess you up check manufactures specs also it may have a voltage rating on the original bulb if it is a special one don’t go on just looks of the bulb 100W and a 50W and they are different look a lot alike check the labels on the bulbs) or the opener. An ordinary run of the mill VOLT meter can steer you in the right direction test from the very back of the light socket "the positive" and the shell that holds the bulb "the negative" . you should get a voltage (I would assume that it is 120 may be there is a transformer got to take a look at it in person) or not from what I see the opener works fine so it must be internal what I would do (if I had a lot of time) would be tear the opener open and check for a lose connection. Or just smell it (just a sec. don’t think that I am crazy just yet) using your senses is a good troubleshooting ability. If something like a transformer bringing down the voltage for a certain bulb, burns up, yeah you can smell it if you get a little closer, or circuit board for that matter. a lot of electronics parts are readily available at radio shack and bring the burnt up part to them and they know everything about sizing resistors or what have you then get out the soldering iron (don’t tear that thing apart with the power to it, some models of openers just have a male receptacle end unplug it) if it is a standard green circuit board just look for a little brown dirt from something burning up (not to hard right just time consuming) if there is more problems post another with a little more info <SEP> How to fix a garage door light?

man, these kinds of intermittent problems can be so frustrating.  i like it better when things break and stay broken - at least you know if you do something and it works, the thing you did fixed the problem, and it didn't just fix itself.anyway is the motor sitting outside or somewhere that the temperature varies a lot from day to night?i used to work at a lab where a lot of equipment was in sheds where the air was just the same as the outside temperature.  sometimes these things would malfunction only at night or only during the daytime - it was because the circuitry was thermally cycled for a long time, and the variations in temperatures makes the circuit components expand and contract.  that repeated expansion and contraction can cause the solder joints and wires to weaken where they are under mechanical stress, and sometimes crack.these cracks can be very hard to track down, because they are so small and because the problem is intermittent.  so maybe you have the same problem where you leave it outside overnight and the circuit cools and contracts, opening up the connection - then it doesn't start until it warms up again and you get in there and wiggle it around.if i were you i would get in there with a multimeter and check to make sure that your connections are still good.  i suspect something is loose and when you take the cap out to check it, you wiggle whatever the loose thing is.  it could be a problem with one of the capacitor leads if messing with the cap fixed it.also, you may already know this, but a 440V 12mF capacitor can store quite a bit of energy - even if you unplug the motor when you work on it, the capacitor can still give you a very serious electric shock, particularly if you have wet hands or even damp skin, which you might if you are messing with a water pump.  so make sure to discharge the cap by making electrical contact between the two terminals with a bleeder resistor, before you touch anything, and let it discharge for a while.  a capacitor that size can be pretty dangerous.good luck! <SEP> How to troubleshoot the  1 hp jet pump ? Hi, I've been using a 1 hp jet pump(for the past 7 years)for lifting water from the shallow well to the overhead tank.I've been experiencing lot of problems due to the excessive hardness of the well water & my motor strucks many times.But this time it is not the problem due to hardness of water.My pump does not starts very often(for example, if I put this evening,it works but the next day it is not starting at all) .When I checked the capacitor(keltron 12.5 MFD 440VAC 50 Hz),it is ok & the coil is not burnt.This time I didn't want to spend more for the technician & removed the capacitor(myself) & checked & refixed it,to my surprise it worked for 3days & again the pump is not running(there is no jam in the impeller).Again I did the same thing as I did before but the pump is not running.My question is what will be the other reasons for the pump not running if capacitor is good & the coil is not burnt & there is no jam in the impeller)
A small flashlight that takes doubles As is hardly worth the hassle, unless it's a mag-lite. If it is a mag-lite, unscrew and remove the butt cap, then unscrew and remove the head assembly. Now you are basically left with an open ended cylinder with the batteries stuck inside. Spray some wd-40 in both ends, let sit a few minutes, then push the batteries out with a flathead screwdriver. Once the batteries are out, use a stiff bristle brush (like a baby bottle brush) and wd-40 to thoroughly clean the interior of the flashlight, springs, and contacts.If it's a cheap plastic flashlight that only opens at the head, you can drill a small hole in the butt-end and use the same method as above. <SEP> How do I remove corroded and swollen batteries from a flashlight?

Portable generators are noisy. If you have neighbors nearby or the noise is unbearable in your house here are some ideas. - Choose an operating location as far away as possible. Note that a larger gauge wire is needed to reduce voltage drop as line length increases. Reducing line loss is required to minimize power loss and to ensure maximum power is available to the house. Lights will flicker less when heavy loads are attached. - Change the exhaust system. Noise from the portable generator systems comes primarily from two sources, the engine block and the exhaust system.. With an air cooled engine there is little you can do about block noise. Some engines can have a larger muffler attached or make other changes to the exhaust system. Merely mounting exhaust pipe vertically will noticeably reduce noise. - Build a noise shielding enclosure. This could be as simple as a piece of plywood to reflect sound away from the house to a separate shed to hold the generator. Design your enclosure with safety in mind. Provide adequate air circulation and ventilation to prevent heat buildup and to remove carbon monoxide. - If the noise bothers your neighbors, invite them over for coffee or offer to run line to their home to power the freezer or a few lights. Talk to them before starting the engine, ask they let you know if the noise is bothersome before they phone the police or harbor any resentment. A little diplomacy can go a long way. - Last resort, shut off the engine or buy a quiet generator. <SEP> How do iI make a loud generator more quit?
Well to start off Im a Plumber and this is a common problem to say the least.But and I hate to use that word. But you didnt say ifd it was Electric or gas That plays a big part in it. And also what size it is 40/50/75 galIf its  Electric it could be a Element that is outIf its gas The thermostat could have went out on you. Not all the way but the easy way to say this is lets say the HWT thermostat thinks the water is 135DEG- But its only 90DEGThis would cause this problem.If you would like to E-Mail me withModel #- SER#What kind  IE- AO Smith/Bradford white (whatever kind it is)How many galElectric or gasIf you give me the numbers off the tank you wont need to give me the Gallons on it the numbers will tell me everything I need to know.The one thing I can tell you is that most people use there tanks year after year and bever maintain it. And thats Why I replace so many in a year.On the bottom side of the tank you will see a hose bib.It will be brass or plastic. What you need to do is hook a hose up to it and open the valve and let out about 10gal of water or untill its clear. This will flush out any dirt in the tank and give it more life.NOTE- Sometimes when you open a plastic valve they never want to shut off correct and they drip. If this happens to you open it and close it a few times this works sometimes if not then you will need to replace it. ( REPLACE WITH BRASS) You could use a cap on it but this is not the correct way to do this. 1 Other thing even though the tank goes from warm to very hot. You should never put it all the way up. There are a few reasons for this.1 You will burn the He** out of yourself or someone that uses it and does not know you have it that hot  like a child2 it tanks the life out of the tank.

Installation is the reverse of the removal. You need to shut off the water inlet and unhook the water line. Then get rid of all the water in the toilet. Flush it, bail it and then sponge it out. Next if the tank is removable, take the tank off the back. Then unbolt the seat from the floor. When you get the toilet out of the way, you need to check the flange for deterioration. If it is rusted out or rotted, replace it and replace the wax seal. Then gently set the new toilet on the flange with the nuts through the base and carefully tighten them down. Not too tight, follow the directions that come with the flange/wax seal. Then install the tank if it is a separate piece and install a new water supply line to the toilet.

As for how to powerwash....Just use your powerwasher on the deck. The high-powered stream should remove all the old stain and dirt that has been acummulating on it. You'll notice the difference immediately once you start.The difference between staining a deck and sealing it is simple. Staining refers to changing the appearance, or color, of the wood. You can use a darker stain to have the deck look like cherry wood or go with a lighter stain to have it look like oak, or cedar. Stain isn't necessary, it just helps to improve the look of the deck.Sealing involves puting a chemical coating on the wood to protect it from the elements, specifically water and moisture. It's a very important part of the upkeep for a deck.As far as what you should do with your deck? That's for you to decide. I would think the sealing is mandatory, but the staining is optional. You'll have to decide if you like the way the deck currently looks, or if you would like to change the wood's finish. <SEP> How do you clean a deck with a powerwasher?

Yes there is a trick or several tricks.First with the em.brake off and the car in Neutral.Take off the tire,using a large hammer smack the drum in between the lug studs several times,this works 99% of the time.Then tap on the back of the drum,be sure not to hit the backing plate and bending it.put both hands on the drum across from each other moving side to side pulling on the drum.It should come off.You must have some brake tools to remove the shoes.You buy these tool at a car parts place where you buy the brake shoes.They can show you what you need.They are not that costly.A repair manual can also be of help and you can buy that there also.Do one side first leave the other side on in case you don't remember how the shoes go on.There is a primary shoe and a secondary shoe just compare them before you remove them.One shoe is longer than the other one.That is another reason not to take both sides off you can always go look at the other side.You should take both rear drums with you and have them turned at the auto parts place.Mark the drums L and R so they go back on the same side they came off of.If you do not have them turned you may experience a pulsation when braking when finished.Check for leaks (fluid)at the brake wheel cylinders,if you have one you must rebuild them or replace them.I would for sure get a repair book.You can get a Haynes or others that are cheap. <SEP> how to change rear brake shoes on a 1998 camry? i was not able to take the rear drum off...is there any trick to it...what are the steps in changing out the shoes?

And after draining the radiator, I recommend filling it with distilled water and running the engine awhile until the temperature comes up and the thermostat is fully open. Then the coolant that was in the engine will be diluted by the water you added. Then drain it again to get a better flush. You could also add a light duty cleaner after the first drain. When your all done flushing it in this manner, empty the radiator one last time and fill with 100% antifreeze. If you've drained the radiator enough times to have essentially only water in the engine, you'll end up with the desired 50/50 water/antifreeze concentration. <SEP> how to drain coolant on a 98 intrigue?

Wow, this has happened to me before!  Actually more than once!First, don't run any water or anything down the drain.  The contact might be already gone, but there's a possibility that it's still in the P-trap underneath the sink.  If you put anything down the sink there's a possibility that it might wash out into the pipes and be lost..The P-trap is the curved pipe you see underneath the sink.  Disconnect the P-trap underneath the sink.  First, put something under there to catch the water that will fall out when you disconnect it.  The P-trap is usually held onto the pipes with some rings.  All you have to do is unscrew the rings.  You might need to use a pliers or vice grip to do this.  After you unscrew the rings, just slide the P-trap off the pipe, and dump the water from the P-trap into your bucket or whatever.  Examine this water for your contact lens.Also, sometimes the contact can get stuck to the pipe inside the sink.  There's gunk on there that the contact will sometimes stick to.  So if you don't find it in the P-trap, check the pipe that goes from the sink to the P-trap.  If the contact is in there, you can dislodge it with a long tool (a stick, pencil, whatever).If it's not in that pipe or the P-trap, you probably won't get it back.  Also, if you're not completely sure that it went into the sink, check the floor and other surfaces in the bathroom.  Sometimes it can seem like they fell in there when they really fell somewhere else.  If you shine a flashlight around it makes it easier to locate the contact because it will reflect the light from the flashlight.  You can see the glint of the light off the contact and that's how you'll know where it is.If you find your contact, of course, you will want to clean the contact lens thoroughly before putting it back into your eye.I hope you find it! <SEP> How do I retreive a lost hard contac lens from the sink drain?

I've been watching my friends search for a while..a little OCD... LOL  and when I search someone who is a friend on facebook and one who is not a friend the most recent searched person moves to the top. I stopped looking at the one who is not a facebook friend expecting him to move down the list and he did for a while staying steady in the same spot for months then he went to the top of my list for weeks...This happened many times so I finally asked him about it and he denies looking at my profile but I don't believe him.  it seems as though facebook keeps track of who you search first then who searches you(unless they look a lot then they go to the 1st position) then anyone you private message then ones you have the most interaction with. <SEP> How does Facebook guess results when you search for someone?

While watching the top left or right edge of the door,push the door up until it hits at the top.Notice if there is any gap between the top of the door and the channel (frame).If there is a gap,you will need a long screwdriver (flat blade screwdriver may work,may have to use #3 phillips)to back the screws out and lower the top rollers (in the top of door).Then if you still cannot lift the door up enough so the bottom of the door can clear the bottom track,you will have to back the bottom adjustment screws out so the bottom wheels retract up into the door.It can be a pain,good luck! <SEP> how do you remove a sliding glass door.?

Here's How:1.   Wear rubber gloves and eye protection while cleaning cast iron since the methods require using caustic chemicals.2.   Begin by spraying the pan with oven cleaner and putting it in a plastic bag.3.   After a day or two, take it out of the bag and scrub it down with a brass brush.4.   If all the grease doesn't loosen up right away, repeat the process concentrating cleaner on stubborn spots.5.   If you have several dirty items, soak them in a solution of one and a half gallons of water to one can of lye mixed in a plastic container.6.   Allow them to soak for about five days, then remove the pieces and use the same brass brush method to scrub them clean.7.   Removing mild rust should be done with a fine wire wheel on an electric drill.8.   Crusted rust can be dissolved by soaking the piece in a 50 percent solution of white vinegar and water for a few hours.9.   Once the pan's clean, begin the seasoning process by warming it in the oven for a few minutes then applying a little shortenting, vegetable cooking spray, lard or bacon fat.10.   Put the skillet back into a 225 degree oven for 30 minutes. Remove and wipe it almost dry to eliminate any pooled grease.11.   Place the pan in the oven for another half hour or so, completing the initial seasoning.12.   The seasoning process will continue with use, especially if you use it to cook fatty foods (bacon, sausage, fried foods, etc.) the first few times it hits the stove.13.   To clean after cooking, boil hot water in the pan. Let it soak for several minutes and then wipe dry with a paper towel.14.   Reheat the pan and apply just enough grease to wet the surface before storing.Tips:Use the methods above only for cleaning iron.Don't soak pans in a vinegar solution more than overnight without checking them because the solution will eventually eat the iron.After cooking, do not use detergent or scouring pads to clean a cast iron pan since this will destroy the seasoning.What You Need:Rubber glovesEye protectionSpray oven cleanerLarge plastic zip bagBrass brush <SEP> how do you remove baked on grease from a cast iron skillet, and  what is the best way to maintain?
