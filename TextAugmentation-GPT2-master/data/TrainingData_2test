You probably don't. You will have to have a large wrench to fit the fan nut so you can remove it from the clutch. These can get stuck tight, and you will need a way to hold the pump pulley while you get that loose. I have a large adjustable wrench that fits (it's an 18"). Sometimes "popping" the end of the wrench with a hammer breaks it loose, some times you just gotta cuss at it!From there, its a matter of removing hoses, and pump bolts.

I would agree with the answer calling your local B.B.B  keeping in mind that you get what you pay for.Dealing with pest especially the larger brands(i.e. Rats)can be and is a frustrating and miserable task.First of all be honest with yourself,can you handle taking on the vermin? are you equipped to handle the outcome using pest control agents such as poison,etc.? are you capable of disposing the dead rats after extermination? By using professions who are equipped to handle the above questions are usually followed up with further treatments of the infested areas.If you should decide to take on the task yourself your first task would be to find the Food and Water source of your particular pest.Bait or trap would be the solution to irradication,keep in mind the safety of any pets you may have or children that could access the treated area.I work a ranch and I have to deal with pest invading the feed bins for my horses.Elimination of the food source will be your first move..give a couple days to see if you had any further visits(droppings,fresh foot prints, etc.)If you have, then the proper bait (Poison)can and should be purchased at your local Feed store that caters directly with issues concerning Ranch and Farm Pest and can help you in your choice as to which brand to use.Most of the poisons used are strycnine(sp)based to prevent odor from dead pest.Also if you choose to go the poison route Please keep any pets that you might have (dogs,cats)its not uncommon for dogs to eat dead rats or mice...and before you use baits such as this Please also consider the Natural rat traps that hunt these vermin(owls,Hawks,Eagles)keep check on the areas baited,and look for obvious signs of area use by the pest and proceed accordingly by either application of more poison or the removal of it if your problem has subsided.I quit the poison end of my problem as it worked okay, but it didn't eliminate it...I finally decided to get a couple of cats ...trading 1 pest for another, because cats can and do become a problem also if not kept in check.Its not the cats fault, but the people who owned them and no longer want the responsibility of them, and simply take them for a ride to the country and drop them off..Cats are domestic animals and are not like there counterparts that survive by the hunt.If you live in city,Cats would probably be your best ally, have them 'fixed'and give them love and food, a warm place to sleep, and they will address the rats,Once rats get the message a new 'Sheriff' is in town they soon vacate. I hope this helps and good luck! <SEP> How do I find a reliable exterminator who won't overcharge me? I have been invaded by rats.  My home methods have not worked so well.

You need to determine if the drywall has been cracked or compromised in any way.  If it has it might not be a simple matter of spackling. You may need to cut a hole square and then shave about a third of the drywall off around it.  Then get a piece of screen, like from an old screen door, cut it to fit the shaved area, and then spackle it in.  Be sure to apply a little spackling before you put the screen in so it has something to stick to from the back as well as the front.  Then wait until the spackling dries and add another layer. Lat that dry as well.  Keep adding successive layers and letting them dry until the spackling is roughly flush with the surrounding surface area.  Then you need to take some 200 grit sandpaper and sand the dried spackling until it's as smooth as it can be and there is very little if any differentiation between the spackled area and the surrounding area.   If you don't think your drywall has been cracked or compromised just forego cutting a hole and add successive layers of spackling.  Let it dry and then paint over it. <SEP> How do you Spackle a wall that has pieces of dry wall missing from slight water damage? -water leak is fixed-want to paint but need to fix the wall first-there is not a hole just some of the outside surface is worn away on the wallplease help

Sounds like a bad rod bearing, but without hearing the noise myself, I can not be sure. If the noise is from the bottom of the motor, it is not a torque converter, but a bearing.

Occasionally a cactus will need to be pruned. It may have rotting stalks, or just seems to be getting unruly looking. The problem with pruning a cactus is that they scar easily, so any cuts should be made should angle inward and be out of sight. Another thing to keep in mind is that branches will not grow from where the cut was made and that a cactus grows very slowly. Cactus will generally only grow a few inches a year, but will live for many years. Prune cactus & succulents (if necessary) in the active growing season, let dry and callusing the wound surfaces allowing a good air flow and removing detaced branches.Here's a great site with directions, photos and tools:http://www.cactuspruner.com/Cacti are such great houseplants.

May I suggest two options. There is a rubbing clay that you can use that you rub in using a circular pattern. This clay is available at auto parts stores and you can use it to start your oxidation.another suggestion, you can use a prewax cleaner or a liquid oxidation remover for removing dead paint and oxidation. Another thing you can try is a rubbing compound and you just rub in on in a circular motion and then wipe it off.After you use the clay or rubbing compound, you need to cover it with a coat of wax to get the scratches back out that the rubbing compound causes. It will give the paint its luster back. <SEP> how do i remove oxidation from  my car?
Set your multimeter to read AC Volts at a range which will work for 120 V. I assume you have already done this.Determine that you have a ground, sometimes the box is grounded, a waterpipe or you may need to get an extra length of wire to connect to a ground and get it to the outlet you are working on.Next measure the voltage from one side of the outlet to ground:If you have 120V this is your hot lead.If you have 0V this is your neutral or non power lead.Take care not to get across the circut with any part of your body. I use one hand. <SEP> How do I determine which wire is hot and which is neutral? The wiring in my house is very old, so the wires aren't color coded (they're all black).

Although many people may suggest tapcon screws or things such as this... you need excersize caution... this may damage the carpet if you are drilling through the carpet... the best thing to do would be cut the threshold to file... use something (pencil, nail. etc.) to mark the carpet under the nail holes (in the threshold)... then cut a small piece of the carpet away from where you will be drilling... *(a drill straight through carpet can cause carpet to ravel or pull strings/lines out of the face)*... after you do this... drill a hole with a concrete bit... then install wooden pegs in the hole (you can buy these wooden pegs in hardware/home improvement stores)... drive them in with a hammer... then use your screws... drive the screws into the wood... and this will hold the threshold in place... <SEP> How do I put down a threshold over carpet on a concrete floor? i am trying to lay a door threshold crossing carpet and tile. the floor beneath is concrete.

A lot of good info here, "esp Questions to ask when considering the purchase of a corn-burning stove."http://energy.cas.psu.edu/burncorn/shellcorn.htmlFrom a news story:Corn-generated heat costs less than a fifth of the current rate for propane and about a third of electrical heat, according to Haefner.

Because of the space needed to store the dried corn kernels burned in the stoves, they are more popular in rural communities and suburbs than in big cities.http://www.breitbart.com/news/2005/12/09/051209141924.flu6l9pn.htmlHere's a place you can buy online w/ free ship.http://www2.northerntool.com/product-1/434180.htm <SEP> How to find about CORN burning stoves?

You'd be money and sleepless-nights ahead if you just cutout the area around the toilet ALL-THE-WAY back to the joists.. You are asking for an eventual dry-rot situation.Do this test...Make sure you are in a joist space (IE not over a joist) and you are not close to a water pipe. At 3ft away from the toilet, drill a 1/4" hole all the way through..  note the effort required..  repeat the test at 2ft and at 6" from the toilet ring... is the floor SOLID at each spot?  If so, then your plan will work... though you should give the floor a week to dry out.1/4 ply is NOT a structural layer.. its only used to underlay floorcoverings, like vinyl.  I would take ALL the 1/4 layer off and re-evaluate whether to do a sub-floor splice of 3/4 ply around the toilet.Also, try to evaluate WHY the wax ring was leaking... IS the toilet flange flush with the existing floor?  If not and its below the floor by any more than 1/4", you may have your answer WHY!!  You need to have the flange FLUSH to the final grade..  TThere are waxless rings that may work better for you. <SEP> how to repair water damaged sub floor?

I would say for the average do it yourself kind of person the only "flush" you can do is take down the transmission oil pan, remove the transmission oil filter and replace it. Be sure to replace the transmission oil pan gasket too if it has one.

Calcium is dropping out of suspension and sticking to the pool surface. Have the calcium hardness checked. There are some stain removers that will soften it up and slowly re-dissolve it, but the process is a slow one. Keep the pH at 7.2 as this stuff is a bit more soluble at a lower pH.

Jerry069 has a very good answer, it also depends on what you are trying to do.

Hello mini-electrician:Basically, the 30 Amp 240 volt female has a corresponding male end that is made for that female. There should be a number on it. There are many companies that make the electrical cord ends and not knowing where you live, the best I can tell is to get that number and go to an electrical supplier, retail store and get that plug.For connection of the female plug, the wiring might be like this....the black wire and the red wire are the two hot lines, 120 volts each and will be attached to the dark coloured screws, the white wire will be attached to the light coloured screw and the green wire will be your ground, the green coloured screw. For connection of the compressor, the is no neutral, hence no 120 volts, rather the two wires, black and red, are 240 volts, with the green wire going to the green screw.Let me know how this works, and if you have questions, then don't be shy, there are no stupid questions when it comes to electricity.Alex <SEP> how can I connect a 240 volt 4 wire 30 amp female  locking to a 240 volt 3 wire 20 amp male?

I had a few vertical scratches on a Pearl red El Dorado Cadillac rear bumper. We had a hard time getting the paint because it was a two part and they didn't sell it in small quantities. We went to a hobby shop and got some matching paint. We didn't do any sanding but painted it twice then buffet between paintings. Working on the plastic is difficult at best. It turned out pretty good but not perfect.

Sounds more like a starter problem than anything else. When you turn your key, the starter motor is energized.

OK there are 2 L shaped metal rods on the top of the headlight assembly.  Turn them and pull them up.  This will allow you to take the whole headlight assembly out.  Once you do that you have to look on the lower section of the assembly that houses the running light.  On the side closest to the middle there is a gray plastic tab kind of U shaped.  You have to push that plastic tab and then the lower section will come out.  The drl is the one on the outside and is a 4157 bulb. Take out the bulb and replace it with new one.  Then when you go to put the lower section back there will be two prongs on the end that must slip in before you push the U shaped tab back in.  Once that is in put the assembly back and install pins and your done.

Dry rubber sponges remove smoke well-without noxious fumes.Then a coat or three of paint will be necessary. 3000 square feet will take 4 people a week to complete. The paint will mask some of the odor. Try incense for the rest. As for the stone on the fireplace there is a product from saver systems that will take care of mild smoke residue, but it may need something more than that. If it does, you will need to vacate the residents for a day. Then you cover the area with heavy plastic sheeting, set up a fan system for fume elimination and break out the industrial strength masonry cleaner/acid available at your local hardware store. DO NOT attempt to fix your own fireplace! Do it yourselfers beware, this is not your realm. One chimney fire is enough, the second one may be YOUR last. There are liners and retrofits for this but improper installation can be more dangerous than leaving it unattended.

If you must open the windows, not just want to see if they open, you can cut the paint seal along the sash or sides of the window with a knife.  Then cut the seal at the top and bottom of the window.  Insert a chisel under the bottom of the window, and as you force the chisel in, the window will break the seal, and move upwards.If you have windows that seal below the sill, take a hammer, and a piece of wood, and a cloth.  Put the cloth on top of the piece of wood.  Place the cloth/wood against the inside of the upper frame of the window that you want to raise, and tap upwards on the wood with the hammer. That should break the paint seal, and cause the window to rise.Good luck. <SEP> how do i open wooden windows that have been painted shut?

If you can see the alternator high up on the engine somewhere rather than stuffed down where it's hard to get to, then it may be an easier job for you. If it's driven off the serpentine belt, insert a 1/2 inch drive breaker bar in the automatic belt tensioner and release the tension enough to slide the belt off the alternator pulley. Likewise, if the alternator is driven off a separate pulley, loosen the alternator mounting bolts, remembering how they go back on the engine when you remove the old alternator. The main B+ wire is thicker and goes to the battery, so disconnect the battery cables first before attempting to remove the alternator wires. The field wires will be on a removable plastic connector that has a tab that needs to be released before pulling it out of the alternator housing. <SEP> how to change alternator on 1994 grand caravan 3.3?

Fill a squirt bottle with full strength Hydrogen Peroxide from the drug store. (The solution is about 3.5% out of the bottle). Squirt the stain and let rest for about 1 minute.

Depending on how old and how dense the stain, you may have to sand the spot and reapply the peroxide several times.

If you are talking about searching, then @akira's question is correct. However, it sounds like you are asking about how to use this condition in a filter.  The trick is that you can put whatever search criteria you want in the filter's Has the words field. For any other field it will prefix your criteria with the field name. For example, if you type user@example.com in the To field, it'll create the filter condition to:(user@example.com) . The reason it works in the Has the words field, is because it doesn't prefix it with anything. This is because it acts as a normal search on the content of the email.   Create or modify a filter.  In the Has the words field, enter your OR condition. For example: to:user@example.com OR from:user@example.com   This is also the place to put any other attributes you want to match (e.g. label: , in: , etc.).  This will also work in the Show search options page, however it's easier to just use a normal search instead. <SEP> How to specify âORâ conditions for Gmail filter

Buy your sweetie a nice dinner out, then humbly ask afterwards.   OK.  Thread your needle and knot thread at the end.  Approach garment from inside with needle.  Put needle through fabric where you want the button to lie and pull the thread through to follow.  Put the button through the needle and let it fall to the waistline.  Take needle and put it downward through another hole.  Repeat this a 3 times or so, then take a pin and put it under the thread holding the button on on the outside of the garment.  Then continue to stitch the button on until you've gone through the button 12-14 times or so.  Stop stitching when the needle is in the inside of the garment.  Push needle through the garment as close to the center of the button but UNDERNEATH the button and pull thread through.  Wind the thread around the underside of the button 3 or 4 times, then push needle and thread through to inside of garment.  Take a little bit of fabric near the button stitches and push needle/thread through until you've got a little loop left.  Take the needle and put through the loop and pull thread taut.  This will "lock" the stitch.  Repeat a couple times, then cut thread.  Remove the pin from the button on the topside of the garment.  (By using the pin in this way, you put a little "give" between the button and the fabric which will make the button lie correctly.   Regarding the hole in the fabric, you can "darn" the hole first by stitching back and forth across it to make a thread base, then use the thread base to stitch your button to. <SEP> How do you sew a button back on a pair of trousers?

One thing you should check before you take your car in for an allignment is the tire pressures... A low tire (front or rear) can make your car's steering pull in the direction of the low tire. Check your car owners manual for proper inflation pressures. If that doesn't help, then you need the services of a professional.Adjusting the front end allignment on your car is not a job for a home mechanic.  It requires some rather expensive equipment and technical knowledge to do the job right.  Your local Ford dealer or most area tire shops have the equipment to do the job. I'd suggest taking your car to one of them. <SEP> How do you adjust the alinement on your front wheels of your car? I have a 2000 ford focus LX and it pulls to the left.

High voltage electricity (anywhere from 40,000 to 100,000 volts) is supplied to the to the spark plug by the ignition system.  The spark plug has an insulated passageway for this high voltage to travel to the electrode, where it can jump the gap and create a spark,  similar to a bolt of lightning. This ignites the compressed fuel/air mixture, causing the expanding gases to force the piston down. This process converts the chemical energy stored in the fuel to mechanical energy. <SEP> How does spark plug works?

In order to gain access to the spark plugs on a 2000 Alero, you must remove the cover on top of the engine that has the engine size.

somewhat odd - but depending on what sort of flush (well -water input) mechanism your toilet uses - the solution might be simple.case 1 - look inside, you have a big float (copper or plastic) at the end of a bent rod. The water is turned on. Push the rod down no more than an inch at the float end. Did the water run and try to fill the tank? if so you're almost done. Hold at the pivot and at the float end bend the rod up CAREFULLY a bit at a time (1/4 inch stages) and when there's enough water to flush ok, you're done. Look out for where the handle fits into the tank, keep at least 3/4 inch below that for water level. And the rise and fall of the float itself, and rod, should not hit or tangle in anything.Case 2 - you can move the float up and down, water starts to run, but doesn't finish filling up the tank. TRy this - there may be a screw at the short (pivot) ent of the float (ball) arm. try turning it (only a quarter turn) counterclockwise, then gently push and pull the arm down and up again. maybe the valve was stuck.case 3- the valve will have to be replaced, kits are available, and cost no more that $20-$25 (CDN so cheaper in the US) plus Rona/Revy can give you a free pamphlet that explains how to do it much better than the Chinese instructions sheet you might get in the actual kit. PS, buy a flex hose to replace the supply line, the solids (copper or plastic) are awful. Spend the extra five bucks.case4 - call a plumber - who will charge $75 to show up (if and when they do) , plus parts and labor. $200 might be getting away easy.  I'd say - check out Revy or the local public library first...;case4 - you dont have an arm based float - just a plastic column. Look at the bit on top, and see whare it sits relative to the level of water in the tank. give it a small poke down, does more water flow? Column style valvesa are almost always plastic, and here you will want to buy a replacement, installation is a half hour job and a good DIY project - these valves are even easier than the lever/float to install and adjust.Good Luck!

I don't know your specific vehicle, but most cars have screws that hold the instrument panel on. Find the ones that go over your instrument panel, and remove them; they may be covered by plastic molding, so be aggresive when looking for them. Remove the dash, or applicable parts, that would hold the instrument cluster in. If you're replacing the whole tach, them reach behind, and unplug all the wires that plug into it. Can be tricky, as some are held in place by the inlet they plug into. Then pull the whole instrument cluster out by working it around the steering wheel. Now, like I said, I don't know your specific vehicle, so if your tach is stand alone, then just take the tach out. However, if it's like the ones I take out, you're gonna have to take the whole instrument cluster out, find what's failing on your tach, and replace it with parts from a good tach. When I did it, it was a circuit card that I had to replace.

Pretty much the same way you drain a gas, oil, propane water tank. There should be a valve at the bottom, it will have a spout with standar threads, the same threads that a standard garden hose uses. connect a gargen hose to the spigget or the valve with the threads, route the hose to where ever you want the water to drain too. Then gently, very very gently open the valve. If you happen to have a water tank with a plastic spigget/valve then you might be screwed. If it's a really old tank the plastic may have dried or rotted to the point it's so weak that an attempt to open it might just snap off the valve completly. If you do have a plastic valve and if it's really old, I would get your friends to help and gather buckets. Average tank size is probably 20 -50 gallons, if the valve snaps and the tank is full then all the contents of the tank will come gushing out. If the valve snaps, it's no biggie to replace it and it's cheap. It's not all that bad, most times it's a breeze but you have to be prepared for the worst. <SEP> how do i drain my electric hot water tank ?

Theres probably two nuts holding the blade on.  Take those off to remove the blade, and the cover right behind that to expose the sprocket.

At the end of the pool season, youâll need to make preparations to safely close your pool for the winter months. Talk to your dealer for the steps you need to take for your climate. The first step toward closing your pool should be to take a water sample to your Authorized SustainÂ® System Dealer. Heâll give you an end-of-the-season analysis and offer winterizing recommendations. Use Sustain Winterizing Products, designed to protect your pool against algae during the off-season, and make opening your pool next season a breeze. Simply follow these steps:Follow your dealer's instructions to adjust Total Alkalinity and other water balance factors during pool closing. You should have 1-3 ppm Free Available Chlorine (FAC) before proceeding to Step #2. Keep the pump running continuously for thorough mixing of chemicals until Step 3 is completed. Pour in Sustain Winter ShieldÂ® Chlorine Extender, using 32 fluid ounces for every 20,000 gallons of water. (Add only six fluid ounces if the pool has less than 7,500 gallons.) "Superchlorinate" your pool, using a double dose of SustainÂ® Shock Treatment (2 pounds for every 10,000 Gallons). Be sure to follow label directions to avoid bleaching of vinyl liners. Clean your pool, filter and all other mechanical equipment thoroughly. Partially drain your pool. Check with your SustainÂ® System Dealer to determine proper water levels and procedures for your climate. Cover your pool with a solid pool cover. Over the course of the pool season, many factors will change the balance of your pool water. When water is added to the pool, whether by rain or your garden hose, the pool water is diluted and the strength of the chemicals is lowered. Remember, the key to effective pool care is to maintain a balance: a change in one area will affect the overall balance of the chemicals. The main water balance factor that will need to be adjusted is pH. Frequent water testing is important to monitor pH and other water balance factors.Three-Way Test StripsAlternatively, use Three-Way Test Strips to routinely monitor pH, TA and FAC. Although extremely convenient, these strips are not as precise as a DPD Two-Way Test Kit. The Three-Way Strips indicate a range, instead of an exact reading. The pH level will read low if TA is 80 ppm or below. Also, the indicator for FAC is different than DPD (its purple, rather than pink), so the readings may differ slightly. When testing with the Three-Way Test Strips, handle the strips with clean, dry hands, keeping the bottle tightly capped between uses. Store in a cool place.SustainÂ® 3-Inch Blue Chlorinating Tablets are the general sanitizing components of the 3-part system. They are designed to deliver chlorine consistently when used with their skimmer dispenser cups. Each tablet contains a patented erosion modifier that controls erosion across the top (exposed surface) of the tablet. Fill the skimmer dispenser cup with 3-Inch SustainÂ® blue chlorinating tablets each week. Adjust the lid opening to increase or decrease chlorine delivery to maintain 1-3 ppm FAC. For in-ground pools, start with the lid off, and use it later, if necessary. For above-ground pools, start with the lid fully open and adjust as needed. Remember that chlorine demand increases with more direct sunlight, heat and greater pool use. Shield Energizer Tablets should be used once a week to act as both a shock treatment and means for keeping SustainÂ® Summer Shield Chlorine Extender charged with added chlorine protection. Unlike the 3-Inch tablets, Energizer does not contain an erosion modifier. The tablets are designed to dissolve quickly (usually within two hours). Add Shield Energizer Tablets each week. Remember to adjust pH to 7.2 (especially if it is 7.5 or higher) before adding Energizer Tablets. Add one cup per 5,000 gallons of water to the skimmer basket. After adding the Energizer Tablets, circulate continuously for at least 5 hours. Your wee <SEP> how do I learn to maintain my pool? testing water and adding the right chemicals

I'm not sure if what I've encountered is the same as you are asking about, but here goes.On older basement windows, metal sash, the glass is held in by spring clips that are roughly in the shape of a capital "A"Lower legs of the "A" fit either into holes in the sash that are pre-drilled for them, or are squeezed into elongated slots. Often the holes are hidden by a residue of old putty.The glass is placed into the sash on a bedding of glazing putty, springs are inserted to hold it in place, and then more putty is tooled onto the edges, covering the springs. The putty serves to prevent breakage from vibration and to provide an air seal.If you have some other design, add it in details and I'll see what I can do. <SEP> how  does the spring clip go into the frame of a metal casement window when replacing the glass?
First you have to jack up the car and support it with jackstands remove the wheels and the center axle nuts (do this before removing the brake calipers so someone can hold the brake for you to get them loose). On some cars it is possible to leave the calipers and rotors onbut not all the time. Next seperate the outer tie rod and ball joint and ush down on the a arm with a large pry bar to swing the strut out of the way. Next pull the axle out of the spindle, It might have to be tapped with a hammer to break it loose. After it is out of the spindle you can try pulling the axle out of the transmission by yanking on it a couple of times but it generally wont be that easy you will have to get under the car with a pry bar and pry it loose from the tranny. Be careful not to pry against the seal in the tranny. Also transmission fluid might come pouring out of the tranny when the axle is removed so dont lay directly under it and have a drain pan ready. To remove the transmission you are probably going to have to take it out the bottom. At this stage you can remove the torque converter bolts, tranny mounts, exhaust, shift cables, wiring, speedometer cable if you have one, and bell housing bolts. Then you can soosten the subframe bols on the engine side about half way out and with a floor jack support the tranny side of the frame and remove the sub frame bolts on that side. Slowly let the subframe down about 6 inches and stop look at your motor and make sure that nothing is binding. If it looks like the transmission will slide out under the body you can then support the motor with a piece of wood running from one strut tower to the other and a strap from that piece of wood to the motor. I like to use a 4x4 for this because it is strong enough. After the motor has been supported you can let the subframe down more and pull the transmission up off of the subframe and out from under the car. Also pay special attension to the dipstick tube it might have to be removed to do this. <SEP> how do i re move axils from a fwd car? i want to take out the trany only

Hard to explain. There are a few Different Diagrams depending on the type of connection you want.

The first thing you need to know is that unless you have spare tile from that exact dye lot, the chances of you matching the color of that tile is slim.

First of all you will need a torques bit for the drain plug.  Then if you are lucky enough to have a spin on filter you just loosen the filter and put oil on gasket of new one.  remove the old filter spin new one on and tighten 1/4 to 1/2 turn.  And put plug back in and put 6 quarts of new oil in it.  But I have a feeling that since you are asking this question you probably have the canister style filter.  This can be easy or a night mare depending on how tight the filter housing was put on last time.  There is a 3/8 ratchet insert on the end of the oil filter housing but if at all possible I would use a wrench on the big nut instead because the ratchet is in the middle and the housing is aluminum and can be brittle.  Either way you loosen the cap on the filter housing and unscrew it until it comes of then the filter will be inside.  Be care full that the housing doesn't turn.  If overtightened last time the chance of the housing and not just the cap coming loose is imminent.  If the housing comes loose you are screwed especially if your are laying under your car to do it.  If you are lucky enough to get the cap off and not loosen the housing then  just take old filter out and push new one in.  Replace cap and then just like the spin on filter both engines take 6 quarts of oil. <SEP> How do I change the oil on a 97 Cadillac Catera?

I have used Victor's Rockcast Exhaust Repair Kit with success. It works like the old plaster casts a doctor used to put on broken limbs. The kit comes with a roll of cloth tape with the "plaster" embedded. You cut it into strips and wet it with a solution of water and hardener. It stays soft long enough to wrap it around the damaged pipe/muffler, then hardens to full strength over a period of hours. It's not a permanent repair, but is useful in a pinch. This page at Victor Automotive shows this as well as several other exhaust repair products. Autozone, Advance, etc stock these. http://www.victorautomotive.net/pdfs/vic/ver2.pdfJB Weld is a good product, too. For small holes, it would probably be your best bet. Any hardware or auto parts store and discount stores like WalMart sell JB Weld. http://jbweld.net/index.phpWhatever you use, the repair will last a lot longer if you make sure the area where you're gonna apply anything is clean. <SEP> how can i make a quick fix on a exhaust leak without taking it to the shop?

The oil pan is under the engine. Put the car up on jack stands and use wheel chocks.  When you get under the car, you will see the pan plug. Remove it and the old oil will drain out. Catch it in a drain pan. Remove the oil filter and replace it with a new one. Replace the oil plug and put in four quarts of motor oil. Start the engine and wait for the oil light to go out or the pressure gage to rise. Look under the car for any leaks. Stop the engine and top off the oil to the full mark on the dip stick. Remove jack stands and wheel chocks. Dispose of used oil as a hazardous waste. Some auto parts stores will take the used oil for disposal or recycling. When you get good at it, the whole operation should take about 15-20 minutes. <SEP> how can i locate the oil pan for my 99 Alero.

tools required:- 10, 12, 14, 21 mm sockets / wrench- 17 mm deep socket- breaker bar- phillips screwdriver- 2 regular jacks- 6 pack budlight or smirnoff 1- jack up the car and remove left tire.2- remove two platic retainers in the cover under the fog light hole, purpose of this is to provide enough room for the fender cover to move around.3- cover underneath the left fender to access the crank pulley. remove two plastic retainers using the phillips screwdriver, remove 3 10mm bolts that attach the cover to the crossmember (radiator support).4- remove both alternator and power steering belts.7- put second jack under the engine and jack it up until you can see the engine moving upwards just a couple millimeters (too much might damage the motor mounts).8- remove left motor mount (the one by the belts) using 17mm deep socket. It will give you better access to the bolts in the timing belt cover.5- remove timing belt cover. (6 10mm bolts)6- with the 21mm socket at the crank pulley give the engine two full turns and align all the timing marks (small arrows pointing downwards you'll find three markings, 2 in the valve cover above the cam gears, and one one the block above the crank) TIP: I like to give the engine the two full turns, verify that everything is fine and then give it an aprox. 1/4 turn more, until i feel there is no resistance in the cam gears, then mark with a chalk stick, makes it so much easier to put the new belt on.6- remove crank pulley8- loosen timing belt tensioner (14mm bolt, left pulley)that should cover everything, replacement is the inverse, should take you about 2 hours. <SEP> how do you replace a water pump in a 1996 kia sephia?

For instructions on line go to www.autozone.com. It has info for the 1994. I believe they will work for the 1996If equipped with an air bag, disconnect the negative battery cable and properly disable the Supplemental Restraint System (SRS), as detailed in Chassis Electrical . Loosen the lug nuts, then raise and support the vehicle safely. Remove the wheel. As required, separate the brake hose clamp from the strut or knuckle by removing the retaining bolts. Remove the lower caliper retaining bolt and pivot the caliper upward, off the pads. Clean the caliper thoroughly; remove any rust from the lip of the disc or rotor. Check the brake rotor for grooves or cracks. If any heavy scoring is present, the rotor must be replaced. Install the pad retainers. Apply a brake-quiet compound (available at most auto parts strores) to both surfaces of the shims and the back of the disc brake pads. Do not get the compound on the braking surface of the pad. Install the pads and shims. The pad with the wear indicator goes in the inboard position. Push in the caliper piston so the caliper will fit over the pads. This is most easily accomplished with a large C-clamp. As the piston is forced back into the caliper, fluid will be forced back into the master cylinder reservoir. It may be necessary to siphon some fluid out to prevent overflowing. Pivot the caliper down into position and tighten the mounting bolt to 33 ft. lbs. (45 Nm). Connect the brake hose to the strut or knuckle, if removed. Install the wheel and lower the vehicle to the ground. Check the master cylinder and add fluid as required, then install the master cylinder cover. Depress the brake pedal several times and make sure that the movement feels normal. The first brake pedal application may result in a very "long" pedal due to the pistons being retracted. Always make several brake applications before starting the vehicle. Bleeding is not usually necessary after pad replacement. Braking should be moderate for the first 5 miles or so until the new pads seat correctly. The new pads will bed best if put through several moderate heating and cooling cycles. Avoid hard braking until the brakes have experienced several long, slow stops with time to cool in between. Taking the time to properly bed the brakes will yield quieter operation, more efficient stopping and contribute to extended brake life. If equipped, enable the SRS system and connect the negative battery cable <SEP> how do you repolace brakes on a 1996 honda sedan v6?

Until recently, it was possible to edit the CSS (stylesheet) and HTML source of a document.

Thompson Water Seal is an oil based product.  The oil in the product causes water to bead up on the surface and tends to prevent the absorption of water.  Naturally, this oil needs to be refreshed fairly often in order to maintain protection.I would mix up a bucket of water and car wash soap and scrub the affected areas with a fairly soft bristled brush.  The soap will cause the oil in the water seal to break down after which it can be rinsed off.  Be sure and rinse thoroughly and rescrub if necessary.  This will give you a huge head start in getting rid of the Thompson's Water Seal.  Keep in mind that this brand of water seal loses its' effectiveness after as little as 6 months in a wet climate.I would also recommend using a stain blocking primer prior to painting your siding with a finish color.Good luck with your project. <SEP> How do you get Thompson's waterseal off of hardiplank siding without damaging the siding?

Mothballs placed around the outside of the house is suppost to repell them.Sodium lamps for porch and outdoor lighting is a great way to save on your energy bill and reduce the number of spiders that find their way into your home chasing the bugs that are attracted to normal "blue wave" lighting. Osage Hedgeballs, otherwise known as Hedgeapples or Sticky Balls (tee hee!) have been used as a natural spider repellent for a long time, but only in the last few years have they gained more mainstream popularity, even if there is no explanation for why they work. They can be found in the produce section of your local grocery store. If not, ask the manager to order them, they're very cheap and widely available.Remember, spiders like to eat other bugs. So, if you spray for other pests, you'll diminish the spiders' food supply and make your home a less inviting place to find a meal. <SEP> How can I keep spiders from coming into my apartment? I'm wondering how to repel spiders from coming through a door.

Or even better, something I could spray to keep them away from the door altogether?
Unless you remedy the conditions that are allowing the mold to grow, it will eventually find its' way back, assuming you could get rid of all of it in the first place.  I'm guessing that you have a very damp crawlspace.  You need to identify the source of the water/moisture and eliminate it.  I'm also guessing that there is not enough ventilation under your house.  At the very least, you probably need to provide additional vents.  A properly ventilated and dry crawlspace is not conducive to the growth of mold.Good luck with your situation. <SEP> how do you get rid of mold under a house?

Problem is filtration. To keep a pool clear and sparkling requires 3 things: CirculationFiltrationProper water chemistrySince you test the water daily the problem has to be one of circulation and filtration. To be frank, the filter systems that come with those pools are a disgrace. To even begin to keep the pool clear they must be operated 24/7. But if you run them that long the life expectancy of the pumps is shortened dramatically. Sorry, but there is no substitute for a quality filter/pump. Wish I had better news.

A very very very fine steel wool, followed with a stainless steel polisher, buff it back to the original shine. This is what a dumb orangutan would do, so you may wish to.........start easier:QUOTEMany people are surprised to find that stainless steel can be stained. Cleaning stainless steel can sometimes seem tricky, but is a very resilient surface. When problems happen, it is best to start with the basics to help repair the surfaces.Baking soda mixed with liquid dish soap can make a good paste to gently rub on stains. Be sure to rinse the stainless steel surface thoroughly, and towel dry.If the stains still remain you can try vinegar. Remember to thoroughly rinse and towel dry.If stains still remain I recommend trying a stainless steel cleaner and polisher.

See if you can Remove the P-trap and clear it that way. IF, it is not the P-trap clogged and further down the drain, you may have to use a small Rotor-Rooter it a flexible spring thing.

Despite requests for this feature since 2009, the Gmail team refused to implement it.  There are however browser extensions and apps that let you schedule new emails or replies:   Streak is a free browser extension CRM for Gmail and has a "Send later" feature (you don't need to bother with the CRM at all). You can conveniently schedule a reply right from the Compose box. I've been using it for about a year and it works very well, except that if I change the Subject line, the message won't go through. You need to go in Drafts and Send it Later from there again, under the new Subject line. Works for Google Apps accounts, as well as Gmail. Best choice.  RightInbox is free for up to 10 emails per month, and supports email tracking via an embedded image (web bug). I've used it in its early stage while it was very buggy and corresponded with its author. You can schedule replies right from the Compose window.  Boomergang is free for up to 10 emails per month.

Momento Mail is a Google App (not a browser extension), and you have to use their own website.

I have been in the plumbing field 20yrs and these answers I love these are the answers that make me alot of money.Quick run down.If it is copper you will need.Copper cutter/Sand cloth/flux/solder/torch/ A Pc of copper/2 Coulpings.1st cut of the bad section Then clean both ends with the sand cloth Also cut the PC of new copper to length if the pc you took out is 2foot cut a new pc 1/8inch shy of 2foot this will give just a little play you will need it.Clean the ends of the new pc and fold the sand cloth in a circle and clean the inside of the coulpings. (You could buy a ID cleaner but since this is a small repair save the 5 bucks.Put flux on all ends of the pipe and inside the fittings then slide 1 fitting on the old pipe slide the new pc into that coupling then slide the other coupling on the new pc of pipe pull the old pipe down a bit and let the 2 slide together. The 1/4 inch will let you do this.Then heat the pipe up and solder. Remember the solder will go towards the heat so heat up the bottom or sode then touch the other side with the solder and your done.Now if the pipe Is galvinized (THIS MIGHT BE A PROBLEM)You need to cut the pipe where the leak is then unscrew it from the fittings. The bad thing about this is alot of times it does not unscrew or it breaks. I Have went to replace a section of GL Pipe and I ended up removing 30 feet.If it is GAL- I would say Get someone out to the House that Has the correct tools. (Trust me)Now if it is Pex as 1 answer said well you cant fix it.although pex is pipeing for water the fittings that are used are special and the tool you would need to have cost about 400Bucks. So you just cant fix pex by going to home depot.Now there is Plastic pipe that looks like PEX But it is not the same thing. And that pipe is used in mobile homes and RV's for the most part.Now last if its PVC  You need Pipe.small saw/primer/glue/2 couplingsits almost the same as copper but you use the primer to clean and prepair the pipe then glue it.But most people have copper. So your answer is above. DO Not use bread or Glue or Tape.1 Other Thing and this is a MUST!!!!! Shut the water off before you do anywork on the pipes.You would not belive how many people forget about this small thing.Goodluck.And if you get stuck and you need help Feel free to e-mail me at kos101@yahoo.comPS- I was not and am not trying to be a jerk to anyone that put there answer to this question. But I have seen so many people do things because someone else has Personal EXp and all it does is make it worse. And evenm though its only a leak I have seen leaks cause alot of damage.

Possible solution...?  I found autosave to be the most frustrating "feature" I've ever experienced - especially when editing text in a cell... at one point I timed the autosave refresh and it was kicking in every 11 seconds.

I about gave up and then decided to clear cache and restart the Chrome... presto!

The only way to address stale air in a building is an air change. You need a filtered supply of outside air. You'll be surprised how well a 12 inch filtered air duct from the outside will help.

Start with gathering some information, from your owner manual or perhaps asking at the parts store.You need to know what grade and quantity of oil you need, such as 5 quarts of 5W30 motor oil.  For some cars, like VW's, Mercedes and BMW's, there may be some special oil specifications your new oil must meet, so make sure you are aware of those as well as the quantity.Also, make sure you learn if the capcity include the filter or not.  If not, find out how much oil you must add when you change the filter.  It's probably not more than 1 quart.Find out what filter you need.Finally, do you need a new crush washer for the drain plug.  Some cars have a crush washer that is supposed to be replaced during the oil change.You will need to gather:Tools, such as an oil filter wrench as well as a drain pan for the oil and a wrench or socket set for the oil.Oh, cheap kitty litter is good for soaking up any spilled oil if you should miss the drain pan.You will need rags to wipe your hands and a clean rag to check the oil.  You will probably also need a funnel and perhaps ramps or a jack and jackstands to raise the car.  Do not work on the car sitting on a jack only, use jackstands.Take a drive, getting the car warm and then return to where you are going to change the oil and raise the car.  Driving to the parts store to get any items you need and returning should be sufficient.Once you have the car up, locate the drain plug on the oil pan.  The oil pan should be at the bottom of the engine. If you cannot tell the engine from any other part, quit now, this is not a job for you.Being careful, since the oil could be close to 200F, place the oil pan beneath the drain plug, allowing some room for the oil to shoot out from the drain.  It may go as much as a foot or so from the opening, so plan accordingly.Carefully remove the drain plug from the pan.  It's a good idea to wear gloves, so you don't get burned by the hot oil.Hang on to the drain plug, or you'll be fishing it out of the drain pan.Remove the filler cap, it will help the crankcase drain.Go have a beverage, call a friend, surf the web a while, give your car 10-15 minutes to drain most of the oil.Now, return the drain plug when the oil is finished draining.  If you need a new crush washer, install it when you re-install the drain plug.Move your drain pan under the oil filter.  Look at the new filter to see what shape and size this item is.  Your old one may be a different color and will certainly be dirty, so don't count on color helping you here.I can often get them off with my bare hands, but if you need to, use the oil filter wrench to remove the old filter.  Drain the old filter into the pan.You may want to take some time and wipe up any spilled oil from your car.  When you remove the oil filter, you probably will spill oil on the car.  Just wipe it off.To install the new oil filter you need two things, new clean oil and your hands.  If your oil filter is vertical, with the opening at the top, it would be good to pre-fill the filter with some oil.  If your filter mounts sideways or the filter mounts with the opening facing down, don't worry, this is an optional nice touch.Put a small amount of clean oil on the gasket.  Make sure the old filter gasket is on the filter and not still on your engine.  Hand tighten the new filter.  Once the filter makes contact, tighten it 1/2 to 3/4 of an additional turn.  It should say how far.  Hand tighten, too tight and you won't get it off again, or it will crush the gasket and leak.Now, fill the engine with the oil change quantity of oil at the filler cap.  If this is the first time changing oil for this engine, I would not add the quantity specified for the filter until you can check the oil level.  Check the oil, if you can see new, clean oil on the dipstick, you probably have enough to start the car at this point.  Otherwis <SEP> how do you change oil?

First we need to find out if your supply piping is copper or iron. If it is iron the pipes are most likely rusty & corroded inside causing restriction of flow. You can also try changing the aerator (that little screen at the end of the spout) if flow is also slow on the cold water side. Most likely it is the supply pipe as hot water will speed up the corrosion which is why you dont see any slowness on the cold side. If iron pipe the only solution would be to repipe the entire house.

Hey if you can check the automatic transmission fluid, you're doing better than 50% of Americans.I hope you checked it while it was warm and with the engine RUNNING! (The proper way to check an automatic transmission)If it was low, you add fluid through the dipstick hole. Typically with the use of a funnel. However, be sure that you don't OVERFILL the transmission or you'll experience a slipping transmission.Most transmissions go from the dipstick "low" to the dipstick "high" in a single PINT! This is half of what they sell. Typically transmission oil is sold in QUARTS. So if you are on the low side of the dipstick, only pour 1/2 of the bottle into your transmission to raise it up to the high mark. If you are only 1/2 down the dip stick marks, only pour 1/4 of your bottle into the transmission. (etc.)To change the trans fluid is a little more intensive than a simple oil change, and I recommend taking it to a mechanic if you are not mechanically inclined. <SEP> How do I add/change transmission fluid? I'm the world's worst mechanic, but I I just checked my automatic transmission fluid and found that it was low, but I can't figure out how to change/add fluid.

If the "backs" that you're refering to are removable cushions, there are a few options depending on how badly damaged they are. If you can remove the covers(zippers?), take out the inner cusion and discard the poly-batting(white cottony looking stuff). You can buy new batting by the yard or in packages at any fabric, craft, or upholstery shop. Re-wrap the old foam cushions in the new batting and put them back into the covers. If your foam is just too flat to save, you can purchase new foam at some fabric stores and upholstery shops also.If the "backs" are not removeable, and re-upholstering is out of the question, you could try to find a seam, open it buy carefully cutting the stitches, remove the old stuffing and re-stuff w/new material(batting). This might work but would probably be the least attractive option. <SEP> How do I make sofa cushions like new again?

4 years... any fuel will probably have turned into varnish by now, most likely battery is bad. To start remove all mouse, bird and varmit nests. Change the oil and filter, turn crank by hand to make sure the engine isn't siezed from rust. Pull fuel line from tank and flush tank with fresh petrol. Reconnect fuel line to tank and put in several litres. Install new battery and petrol pump. Clean and gap plugs, install new plug wires. Check all electrical for chewed or frayed wires(even covered and garaged the mice get in). There may also be flat spots on the cam after sitting for so long.

Hi KDiddy, the previous answers are correct on the cleaning and painting, and dewhittjames touched on ventilation.  Ventilation is the most important thing you can do in a bathroom.  Without ventilation even new fresh paint will mildew in a short time.  It'll be up to you on what type and where to put a vent fan, but to really help keep the mildew away, it has to be done.  Check the links below, the first is a Lowe's link that will show you how to install a vent.  The second is a link to a site that will give you an idea of what type of fans are out there and maybe what you can look forward to spending on one.  So keep this in the forefront of your project, you may want to do this before any painting ensues.  This would keep you from possibly damaging any finished product.  Good luck to you! <SEP> How do you get rid of and prevent mildew on the bathroom ceiling? I'm also planning to paint the bathroom but it's peeling in some places.

to correctly check your pressure tank you must first turn off the breaker/power to well .   Drain the tank by using the closet drain to the pressure tank. We install a water bib on the tank tee for this reason. Once you have drained all water  wiggle tank and see if it still has water in it. If it is heavy with water your bladder has developed a pinhole and the tank needs replaced. If bladder is good all water will leave tank.   NEXT using an airgauge check air in tank , it should be @ 28 lbs if your pressure switch is set to come on at 30lbs  . NEVER should they have 50lbs of air!   If you have a gauge on your tank tee and it is working correctly which they do fail fairly easy . You can find your cut in pressure by turning on power and refilling pressure tank. Once full turn on water somewhere and watch gauge on tee to see where the pressure switch kicks on and calls for water. You want to set your air pressure lower than the cut in pressure by at least 2 lbs. If you have any questions e-mail me and I will answer your questions. DO not listen to the previous answers.

The first and most important thing you MUST do is to disconnect BOTH of the battery cables from the battery. Now, locate your starter and if space allows remove all the wires that are attached to the starter solenoid. Next remove the two large bolts the hold the starter to the engine block. You may need to loosen or remove one or more sheilds around the starter. Once you have removed those two bolts, it should come right out. Now, when you go to install the new starter, be sure to read the installation instructions very carefully. You may be REQUIRED to install a shim between the new starter and the block to ensure proper starter engagement with the flywheel.Once you have determined whether or not you need to install a shim, you can place the new starter in the same location as the old one and reinstall the two starter attaching bolts.  Then reattach all of the wires in EXACTLY the same locations as they were removed.Then reinstall you battery terminal cables and start vehicle.The starter should turn the engine with a minimum of noise. If the starter does not want to turn the engine over easily, the starter is too close to the flywheel and you will need to add a shim. If the starter makes a grinding/whirring sound when engaged, it is too far from the flywheel and you will need to install a thinner shim or remove it all together. I hope that helps! <SEP> How do i change a starter on a 1991 OLDSMOBILE CUTLASS CALAIS? is there a good wibsite that will tell me how to change it?

How exactly are you going to get the right amount of air flowing through the passenger cabin?  Are you driving a race car with forced air induction from somewhere?  If not then you are wasting your time.  A cold air intake requires you to mount it low OUTSIDE the passenger compartment.  The air wont be colder unless the inside of your car is below 0 and being forced to the motor with a supercharged fan.  Just remember the KISS principle.  Keep It Simple Stupid!  I'm not saying your stupid its just a term.  A 4x4 snorkel is not the same as a cold air intake.  The snorkel allows you to drive your truck through mud and water that is over the level of an unmodified truck.  My truck has a snorkel mounted on the roof and in theory I can drive it through water that deep without stalling.  If I tried to drive it on the highway like that then I would probably loose it or get some foreign debris in it.  Mount your cold air intake inside the engine compartment just above the front valence.

Sorry but acid it the wrong thing to use.   If there is a lot of oil build up use a strong putty knife or scrapper to scrape up the oil, which if it is old, will be more like black tar.  Place all of the oil reside in an old newspaper that you have unfolded nearby.   Then use lacquer thinner.  Lacquer thinner will not contain oils that are present in many solvents and it will dry quickly.   Use a liberal amount in a small area (approximately 1 square foot) and use an old rag to draw the oil out of the concrete.  Repeat these steps as necessary to totally remove all the oil.  With a clean hand, make sure that there isnât any oil residue left.   After this, if you still have a stain, buy a good âdrivewayâ cleaner that is designed for use with concrete that wonât damage or bleach out the concrete.  I have done this many times with excellent results.  Good luck.Dennis in Anaheim <SEP> How can power steering fluid be removed from a driveway?I Even tried acid and it didn't work..?

Spiral balances are notorious for failing.  Read your warranty.  Many times window warranties are written in such a manner that the integrity of the glass is guaranteed for 10 years or more while the mechanical parts (ie: spiral balances) are only guaranteed for 1 year.  If they are still under warranty, your contractor should replace them.If the spiral balances are found to be out of warranty, all is not lost.  You should be able to easily figure out how to remove the defective balances.  Take tham to any glass shop and they will order replacements for you.  Some of the larger glass shops will often keep them in stock.  They should cost you under $10.00 each.  They are so cheap, you might want to purchase a couple of extras in the sizes you are most likely to need in the future.If you have a window or two that you rarely open, you may be able to swap out the balances with the window that you do use in order to get by for a while.Good luck with your repair. <SEP> how can I fix a window with a broken spiral tube balance?

1. Get the oxygen sensor you need from the parts counter of a Dodge/Chrysler dealership. Emissions problems can be really tough to track down, so for this you want to spend the extra money to get the real thing. Know engine size, transmission type, year, CA emissions or not, high altitude or not, etc. before you go to the dealership, since all these things might cause a different version of the sensor.2. Replace air filter and PCV valve before you put in the O2 sensor. PCV valve should be changed with every oil change. Fresh oil and filter are always a good thing. (Reason? Oil blowby contaminates O2 sensors.) I also replace fuel filter (never gets done) and check fuel pressure, since if these things are poor, the computer may misinterpret them as an O2 sensor. 3. Disconnect the battery. Not strictly necessary, but always good practice, especially since wrenches have a magical way of falling between the starter motor's positive lead and ground. It may also clear the ECM's RAM. 4. With exhaust system warm but not hot, use a combination or deep socket wrench to get off the old O2 sensor. I usually cut the leads off the old one first. Remember you cannot splice an O2 sensor's leads. Use a 6 point socket for better torque, the sensors have a habit of being corroded into place. 5. Apply the anti-seize compound which came with the new sensor. Thread it in by hand and then torque it to specification using an O2 sensor socket and a torque wrench. 6. Plug the new O2 sensor into the harness and reattach the wires to supporting clips. 7. Reattach battery and start up the truck. The truck may behave oddly for a few minutes as the computer re-learns that the feedback system is now working properly and re-enters optimal closed loop mode. (ie. Check Engine light goes out and computer stops throwing diagnostic errors.)8. Re-read fault codes in a week. There should be no new codes. Single-wire (non-heated) O2 sensors are usually cheap enough to get into the habit of changing them every 50,000mi or so - basically every set of tires. O2 sensors get slow in time as deposits cover them. Keep the engine in tune to keep deposits to a minimum. Tune-ups (plugs, leads, cap, rotor, etc.) and fresh O2 sensors will save you gas money. <SEP> How do I change the oxygen sensor in a Dodge Dakota?

A few things leap to mind. First, gas in the oil is very bad. It thins the oil to the point where it is no longer lubricating the engine, and your engine will self-destruct if you run it. Second, what you now have in your engine is an explosive vapor. It can explode, or at least ignite. Third, well, there is no third, since the first two are enough to ruin your day. The problem often occurs when a mechanical fuel pump driven off the camshaft develops some kind of leak and pumps gas into the crankcase. I used to work for a VW mechanic, and I fixed this problem several times, including the part about draining rather explosive oil from the engine. It can also occur if your carburetor or fuel injection system has a problem like a stuck float needle or some other problem that is allowing fuel to be dumped into the engine. If you do not get it fixed, you will not have to worry about checking the oil, at least not in this car. Maybe the one you replace it with, but not this one. <SEP> How do I keep gasoline from leaking in to my oil?

They may even have a diagram that shows where it should go.If you don't have a diagram, and if the old one isn't completely bad, you can find it by turning the key to the position where the turn signals work, and turning on the right or left turn signal.  Put your finger on the top of each of the things under the dash that look like the one you bought from the parts store. The flasher will be the one that has the strongest clicking feel.  Remove it by pulling gently. Plug in the new one, being sure to line up the pins on the bottom with the socket under the dash.And you're done. :) <SEP> How do I install a flasher into a 1995 Buick LeSabre?

According to the website below:When your gas gauge reads empty, your tank is filled with air instead of fuel.  As you add fuel, the air must move out of the tank to make way for the gas.  Next time you fill your car at the gas station, take a look at the pump nozzle.  You will find a hole about a half inch from the end of the nozzle.  This hole is connected to a small pipe that travels through the nozzle to the handle.When you fill your gas tank, some of the displaced air flows through the hole in the nozzle into the pipe.  When the tank is full, the hole will be below the gasoline level and no air will pass through the pipe.  A mechanical switch inside the nozzle detects when the flow of air stops and shuts off the gas.You may have noticed that, after the pump shuts off, you can get more gas in your tank by pulling the nozzle out of the tank a bit.  This is because youâre moving the position of the hole relative to the gas level and allowing the mechanical switch to reopen. <SEP> How does the gas pump know when your tank is full?

Depends on if the plastic housing is broken or if it's just a bulb.Usually a bulb is accessed by removing the nuts holding the cardboard plate accross the back, moving the plate forward towards the back seat and the bulb assembly will rotate lft turn a bit and can then be backed out. On some the lamp is a push in. Just pull it out and slip a new one in.If the housing is broken it is strictly a dealer part. But you can replace it by removeing the nuts along the perimeter of the housing. After removing the plate nuts.Likely you will also need some new sealer as it doesn't come with the housing. <SEP> how do i replace the brake light in a 2004 Lincoln LS.

yes. simply dont hook up the ground. first, make sure the tool is double insulated (look on the nameplate for a symbol of a box inside another box, or the words double insulated)your tool should have this due to the 2 coductor cable you've mentioned. cut the existing cord cap off of the tool, strip back the outer sheathing of the cable carefully not to nick the inner conductors. if u can see wires note colors, the black wire is going to go in the brass screw terminal of your new cord cap this is your "hot wire"and the white wire is going to go under the silver screw terminal this is youre neutral wire". the green terminal is your ground simply dont land a wire on this terminal. note you'll only be able to use this tool in a grounded 3 wire recepticale. don't worry these are a common code practice. if your cable is similar to lamp cable then look for some type of identification on the wire such as a ribbed stripe in the insulation itself or writing on a wire. this wire is your neutral wire the other is your hot. follow above instructions. also note, do not leave any extra free conductor of wire and dont strip more outer sheathing than you need. remember you want it to end up in the cord cap.good luck <SEP> how do you replace a male connector on a power tool? my tool has a two mprong connector but the connector i bought has a ground is it still compatible

Cold house with the thermostat turned up? I had moved a lamp directly underneath the thermostat.

Well...  I hope you're talking about clutch (brake) fluid.  If so it will not be an internal transmission problem.  There is really only one of 3 things it can be: the master cylinder, slave cylinder, or the line itself.  Check the line for leaks and the slave as well.  If there is only fluid near the slave or no fluid at all it is probably the slave, but replacing a slave can sometimes cause the master to go out a short time later.  On a Honda, to just buy a master is probably expensive so I would just change the slave.  Just don't kill me if you replace your slave and find its the master.  You may need them both replaced, and if this is the case getting a new clean line is best also.To replace the slave, you should first loosen the line and let the fluid drain.  Try to pin the line up to prevent all the fluid from draining, but if not we'll bleed it anyway.  Now loosen the bolts holding the slave cylinder to the transmission and remove.  The push rod on the slave my be connected to the clutch fork somehow, you'll have to figure this part out (I'm not a Honda tech I work on diesels lol).  The inside of the boot may be holding all that fluid so be careful.  You should also notice the mounting of the slave.  Make sure the the bleeder screw is facing up.  THIS IS IMPORTANT AS IF IT DOES NOT FACE UP YOU WILL HAVE TO BLEED IT BEFORE INSTALLATION.  Now insall the slave onto the trans and loosen the bleeder.  Hook up the line (remember line wrench) and Fill master cylinder.  Use DOT 4 brake fluid.  You will see fluid start to flow out of the bleeder (hopefully) and when it is steady close the screw.  You may need to get help for this part.  Have a buddy pump the pedal.  Then tell him to hold it down (all the way) and open and close the bleeder.  Keep the fluid level up and when no more air squirts out it should be bleed.  Bleeding a clutch can be hard, it may take a very long time.  There are also other methods you can use.  If you're unsure I wouldn't do it yourself as you may wind up needing a tow truck.  Hope this helps. <SEP> How do u change the slave cylinder on a 96 Honda Passport? I guess that is what is wrong.  It has used a little fluid about once every 2 weeks, and now it has went to maybe 2 days.  Is it in the transmission?

Label all wires with tape.Disconnect the wires to the black box (ballast) and then unmount the box from the fixture. Take the ballast to an electrical supplier and match up the make and model and input and output. Some fluorescent lights run on 220 and some on 110. It is usally cheaper to buy a new night fixture than to replace the ballast. <SEP> How do you change a ballast in a fluorescent light?

Some models have door hinges that are adjustable. If that is the case, I would try to readjust those two hinges so that the door opens and closes properly. If those hinges are welded! Then I would remove the inside panel and hammer those dents into place using a hammer and piece of wood. Doing so will probably stretch the door back to its proper place so that it will open and close more or less correctly, until you get it fix properly at a dealer shop. <SEP> How do you fix collision damage that has caused the car door to barely open? I backed into my husband' car with mine and dented in the area just in front of his driver's door.  The door now barely opens.

I can't afford that right now.  Any suggestions?

I have 1/2 HP screw drive garage door opener. I like this model because it has a SAFE-T beam feature that stops the door if a child is under the door while the opener is closing down. Now, the problem is that when I use the control by the wall, I can close it but when I use the remote control, I had to press it so many times before the door closes, if at all. 95% of the time, the door just starts to close and then springs back up, even if there is no object obstructing the laser beam at the bottom. I have cleaned the glass of the "eye", replaced the battery for the control with a new, fresh one, replaced the coil springs and still no luck. I am resigned to getting out of my truck each time and use the wall control and lower the door to a point where I can I can slip right thru and use the remote to close the door completely.  In short, I have to use both the wall control and remote control to open and close my garage door.Any suggestions? Help!

Using a dremel tool with a fiberglass cutting disk, carefully cut out the grout around the metal holder making sure not to damage the tile around it. Tap the metal holder with a hammer lightly, around edges and at the center, the holder should pop loose. If the holder has failed to loosen, brace a quarter inch hardwood board against the good tile and using a flat chisel or a small crowbar, ply against the lip of the holder using the wood for leverage for the prybar. Carefully pry to and fro, chipping out any obstructions. Be careful, take your time, be patient, and you will be smartly rewarded. You can do this!

You can't. Lamps are designed to take a certain bulb because of the heat output. You can always switch to a 130 watt florescent bulb.

Mr. plevine, you first have to determine whether your system uses R-12 or R134a before servicing or troubleshooting it. How do you know whether the system in your vehicle uses R-12 or R-134a? LOOK FOR SPECIAL INDENRIFICATION DECALS OR LABELS ON THE MAJOR COMPONENTS.What else should you look for? The high-side low-side service fittings on an R-134a system are completely different from those used on an R-12 system.On an R-12 system, the high-side service fitting is a 3/8-inch 24 for screw-on couplers; the low-side fitting is a 7/16inch 20 (also known as 1/4-inch flare fitting) On an R-134a system, the high-side and low-seide service fittings are special 1/2-inch Acme-type fittings with no external threads. They have internal threads, but they're for the specially-designed caps unique to R134a fittings. Mr. plevine look for a RED-CAP for high-side BLUE-CAP for the low-side. Be mighty-careful when you service airconditioning system.GOOD LUCK! <SEP> How do i find my low pressure line on my  98 buick park ave a/c system?

Home Depot or Lowe's has a Quickrete product called 'Commercial Grade Blacktop Repair' that you can use.www.quikrete.com/catalog/CommercialBlacktopRepair.htmlAll you need to do is clean out the repair area of foreign debris and repair the sub-base with pea gravel or other appropriate base material for your area (match the repair to the existing sub-base).

Generally, the floor joists are 16 or 24 inches on center apart. You take the roll of insulation and unroll it between the joists.

Assuming you've already checked the wiring and it's fine, theres a trick I've used a few times before. First, make sure there is NO power going to the fixure. In the bottom of the socket is a tab that completes the circuit by contacting the bottom of the bulb. Use a pocket knife or something to scrape the contact point clean then bend it up a little as over time it can be squashed down to the point that it doesn't make contact anymore. Hopfully, that will do the trick. <SEP> how do i get a light socket to work? Have an outdoor light, one socket works, the other doesn't. What can I do to test it to see if it needs to e replace
If it is your own video, you can download the subtitles from the video manager. Go to:  Video Manager >> Edit (on the video you want) >> Captions >> (Click on the track you want to download) >> Actions (drop down box)  At the time of writing, there are three file types available:   .vtt  .srt  .sbv   These have different uses in different applications, but are very similar. SRT is probably the most common.  Otherwise, if it is not your video, the best method (only method) is to get the xml file from the Developer tools.  Using Google Chrome in this example, navigate to the video then follow these steps:   Pause the video. Wait for it to play if there is an advertisement.  Push F12 on your keyboard. This opens the developer tools. You may have to click on some empty space in the page so that the video is not active.  Click on the Network tab in the Developer Tools.  Click the transcript icon just below the video. Two items will come up in the Network tab in the Developer Tools.  Both items are titled timedtext? plus a bunch of variables. The second one is typically the one you want. It starts like this:  <transcript>      <text start="4.14" dur="3.049">my name is doctor john rush</text>      <text start="7.189" dur="3.731">I'm the CEO and president</text>   This xml file is useful if you want to use the transcript in a web page. Other than that, I don't think you can use it the same way you would use an SRT file. If you are any good at programming, you can easily write up a program that will convert it to SRT. I wrote my own C# program that extracts the data for a different purpose and it took less than two hours. <SEP> Downloading auto-generated YouTube transcriptions

If you already have a phone jack in the back of your computer, then the above user is correct.  If you do not, there may be several approaches to solving your problem.First you need a modem.  If you want to use the computer to answer the phone, save and play voice mail, etc. then all you need is a data/fax/voice modem.  They are installed as a PCI card in an available slot in your computer, and provide a phone jack for the physical connection.  They usually include software for sending and receiving faxes, voicemail, and receiving and making voice calls.  You will need a microphone and speakers, or headset (easier to use)Here is an example of a PCI fax/data/voice modem: http://www.compusa.com/products/product_info.asp?product_code=50179302&pfp=BROWSEIf you want to connect your phone line to your computer for internet access, a PCI fax/data/voice modem will work, but is very slow.  You can also connect to the internet via your phone using a DSL modem.  DSL uses wires in your phone line but does not prevent you from making or receiving calls on your house line.  DSL is also much faster than "dial-up" internet access using the PCI fax/data/voice modem.For connecting a DSL modem, you will need a 10/100 Ethernet PCI card instead of the PCI fax/data/voice modem.Well, I hope this helps.  There may be other ways to do this, such as Modems with USB connections, etc.  but i am not sure about those.Good Luck.-Neil <SEP> how do you hook up or phone to your computer?

OK, don't use soda or any water-spraying methods - they will just spread the oil around and make it worse.  Oil floats on water, remember? Here's what you do:  If there is liquid oil sitting on the drive, use oil absorber, cat litter, or sand (in order of effectiveness) to absorb it..  Just dump it on and sweep it around until it is absorbed, then scoop it up and dispose of it.  To get the rest, I've had luck with "Castrol Superclean" full strength.

You add more salt pellets to the holding tank as they are used up.  You should never have to remove the pellets that are in there.  If your tank is only 1/5th full, you should add more to fill it back up.  If you are getting contaminates through your tap you will need to install/replace your filter.  Remember, a water softener is not a water filter.  If the contaminates (probably sand) are a permanent problem, than I would install a filter.  If you install it where water first comes to your house from the main, then you are stopping contaminates from the source.  Wait and see if this is a permanent problem though.  New construction in the area or servicing to water mains or hydrants will cause sediment in water mains to come loose and eventually find their way to your taps.  This normally stops. <SEP> how does one know when/how to replace salt pellets in a water softening system? there is a big platic tank filled about 1/5th of the way with salt pellets and water.  a tube goes from this tank to the water purification tank that is a heavy, wound tank.  the water is coming out of the tap with some contaminates in it.

Without knowing what your setup looks like, I can only give generalizations. Before taking out the tub, make sure the doorways in your house are wide enough to get the tub through.1. Disconnect the water supply to the tub.2. Disconnect the faucet if it is attached to the tub.2. Disconnect the overflow.3. Disconnect the tub drain.4. Remove anything from around the tub that could be holding it in place.5. Remove any fasteners holding the tub to the wall. Usually there aren't any, esp. on older tubs. Their weight holds them in place.You should now be ready to move the tub. Get at least one more person to help you move it out. If it's an iron tub, get at least two more people.

The first answer is probably the best one, but you don't say where it is. If it's rising damp, ie coming up from the ground then you need damp proofing - probably best to do this by injection into the wall (see a builder). If it's being caused by something else and is therefore not coming up from the ground then you need to find out where from - is it cos your cavity is "leaking" somehow (see a builder) or maybe you have condensation caused by humid air condensing on the cold wall - normally external wall. If its from condensation then you can use a de-humidifier (to take the moisture out of the air) and turn up the heat to dry the moisture form the wall to the air. The you can turn the heat down again and use the de-humidifier either intermittently or constantly - whatever it takes. To reduce moisture in the air try opening window during and after bath,shower,cooking and dont dry clothes inside. If you're not sure about any of this see a builder. <SEP> How do I get rid of "damp" in a wall?
First, don't go directly down the drain. If you are snaking a sink, remove the p trap and go in from there. If you are snaking a tub, remove the overflow cover and go in from there. If you are snaking a toilet, it is best to remove the toilet and go directly in the pipe so you don't scratch or mar the porcelain. Push the snake in until it won't go anymore then tighten the locking wingnut or squeeze the handle, whatever mechanism there is, to lock the snake in place, and start turning the handle. This will eventually push the snake past whatever stopped you, whether it was the clog or just a bend in the pipe. Whenever I snake a drain, I run the full length of the coil into the pipe just to make sure I got everything. When you've reached the end of the coil and start pulling it back out, make sure you're cranking the handle. This will clean out all the accumulated crap stuck to the walls of the pipe, to reduce the chance of future clogs. <SEP> How do you use a snake to clean out a drain?

The rivet tool is used to install rivets.  To do so you must drill an appropriate sized hole in the pieces of metal to be joined.  The size of hole will depend on the rivets you are using and the package will most likely state the size hole.

With a picture I could answer you're question. I have seen tables go from Italy to Canada without a hitch.  Bad manipulation from lack of knowledge is usually the cause.

There should be a handle beside the gear selector whether it be Auto or Manual. You can choose between 4x4hi, 4x4low or part time 4x4. Generally you use 4x4 hi for soft roads, wet conditions etc and 4x4 low for more serious 4x4ing because it uses low down torque.

BPSKI is wrong.  The 98 has two belts regardless if it is a DOHC engine or a SOHC engine.

Tina tinkerbell does timing??? I am afraid to answer this one because if you have cranked the motor without the timing belt you have probably damaged the valves, if as I suspect you were smart enough to replace the timing belt before cranking the motor then the belt could have slipped a notch and just be in the wrong position. This is not entirely good news cause you could have still damaged the valves. I will proceede with the assumption that the valves are undamaged and hope for the best. First you need to get the no.1 cylinder in the tdc position That's top dead center if you don't know already. Then you will find a notch on the the pulley that drives either the camshaft or the valves depending on how many valves you have. If it is two valves per cylinder you will have a camshaft, if it is three or more then you most likely have a pulley for each camshaft (more difficult). anyway there has got to be something to line up this notch with. I would suggest that you go to your local auto parts store to get the manual for this vehicle and it will tell you exactly where this mark is, otherwise the notch will be straight up. And then you just slip the belt back on when the mark is straight up and presto chango the car should start.as long as nothing else is broken.Aloha!!!origionalsurfdude@yahoo.com <SEP> how do i set the timing on a 91 volvo 740 turbo.?

Im A plumber so here is you answer.Its hard to answer You didnt say where it was leaking.A quick run down You have a fill valve/  Douglas Valve/Flapper/Tank to bowl gasket with bolts and a wax ring with or without horn.1st dry off the WC (water closet=Toilet) and try to find out where the water is from2nd if its on the floor then its is the wax ring. Remove the supply line and bolts and replace the wax ring. if its where the bowl and tank meet then its the tank to bowl gasket set (3.99 Home depot) Remove bolts and gasket and replace. TIP when putting the new bolts on use plumbers dope on rubber washers to make a good seal also put Dope on gasket and tank and bowl for good seal. If its from there area where the supply line is going in thats the fill valve. Most WC have a valve with a rod and long ball on the end. DO not replace it with the same one Go to Home depot and Get A fluid master 400a And replace. And supply line check connections if bad then replace.3 other things could be a hair line crack in tank or bowl.also the flapper. inside the WC best way to check use some food coloring from the kitchen put 5 or so drops in the tank stir up a bit in 20 min or so if you used red and the water in the bowl is red then flapper is bad but this could also mean The seal or unit its on is bad. Replace. (this is also a good thing to do at 1st use the color red or blue and where you see it is where the problem is.but last WC= will sweet the temp of the water and the temp outside if there is a certain change it will sweet. You can fix it will a liner in the tank. Home depot again.But with all this info you might have a Kohler 1 PC wc and some of this does not even apply I wish you could have gave some more info on the unit.

If your car failed the ASM California test with elevated HC, it is best to perform proper diagnostics to identify the cause, then repair the cause.Assuming that your car in fuel injected, here is a list of POSSIBLE failures -- 1)  Vacuum leaks2)  Excessive advanced ignition timing3)  A MAP or MAF sensor slightly out of spec. voltage4)  Excessive engine coolant temp5)  EGR valve pintle stuck open6)  Restricted fuel filter7)  Failing fuel pump8)  Failing fuel pressure regulator9)  Sleepy, lazy or otherwise failing oxygen sensor.10) Contaminated engine oil11) PCV valve in need of service.12) Failed or deteriorating catalytic converterThere are many other items, but they are generally related to the above list.It is money saved to take the car to a LICENSED emissions repair and test facility, and ask that they run a diagnostic routine for the elevated hydrocarbons. Take the failure report so that he can look to see what he is chasing.Most shops will perform this task for about an hour's worth of shop time. The repairs will be on top of the diagnostics.One of the things that the tech can do with the report is to calculate the "LAMBDA" factor. This will tell him if the engine is in good fuel control or not, and if the primary cause is in the fuel control or if it is in the catalytic converter.If you believe you are being taken advantage of, call the Bureau of Automotive Repair at (800) 952-5210 and ask that they investigate. This is your tax dollars at work. Use them.In the mean time, if you are trying to get the license renewed, pay the fees. It is the State of California, they will take the money! That will stop the penalties at DMV. You won't get a sticker, but you will be paid up. Ask for an extension for driving. This will get you about 90 days more to make the repairs and pass the emissions test, or make the decision to trade the car in for something else.Good Luck <SEP> how can I reduce hydrocarbons (high and low speed) for a california smog test?
On the vast majority of engines, if the timing belt snaps, say goodbye too your valves, piston, or engine in general.Some cars (very few) have a "FREE RUN" engine. These are so low performance that when the belt breaks, the engine will just stop, because of the valves no longer functioning.HOWEVER, most engines' valves operate close enough to the pistons, with the TIMING of both the only thing keeping them from running into each other.When the belt breaks, the cam stops turning, so the valves stay in whatever position the happen to be in at the time.Because of the crankshaft still trying to turn (think inertia, centrifugal force, etc.) the pistons are still going to move a bit, until the energy in the crankshaft is used up, OR THEY HIT SOMETHING, LIKE AN OPENED VALVE!You WILL either:a)bend a valveb)crack a piston headc)crack a piston (with the broken off pieces scarring up the cylinder wall, remember, the piston will continue to travel a little bit)d)crack a cylinder wall, possibly through the water jackete)all of the above-or-f)none of the above, because ya might get lucky, as even a blind squirrel finds a nut now and then! <SEP> How does Timing Belt affect the Engine? I have a 97 Volvo 850 gasoline car.

I was told that it's very important to have the timing belt replaced before it breaks but the belt is working alright so far.  They said if it breaks, it's going to damage the engine and it will be very very costly...  Any opinion and suggestion out there?  I appreciate if someone can give me a second opinion.  Thanks!

first the oil filter is on the passenger side of the motor you have to remove it from the top make sure when you replace the filter you fill it with at least a quart of oil"15w40" your choice of brands. after you complete this portion you move to the bottom of the truck if you look up you will see the oil pan at the rear of the pan is the drain plug, remove slowly so not to get oil all over you when the oil comes to a very slow drip replace the drain plug it only requires 25lbs. of torque so don't over tighten to much. now wipe up the old oil from the bottom of the oil pan and get back under the hood depending on the engine size you will need between 10-16 quarts start with 9 quarts start the truck and let the oil pressure come up look while it's still idling for leaks. let sit for about 1 min. pull the dipstick and check oil level add until it's full. the filter is very awkward to tighten but make sure it's tight.... <SEP> how do you change the oil on a 85' ford diesel pick up? where? and how
You can throw on a new intake and some new pipes out the back.  Improved air flow in and out of the engine will always do the trick.  An aftermarket computer programmer will also take care of the fuel curve, but while it adds more horsepower, you will lose a mile or two per gallon.  They're incredibly easy to use anymore...they just plug into your diagnostic port, which is normally under the dashboard.  If you want even more, you can add a larger bore throttle body.  Again, this will require a bit more fuel so that the ngine doesn't lean out, but your programmer should take that into account and will take care of that.  You could go on forever with upgrades and aftermarket stuff, but they're typically the cheapest and best start.  Check out http://www.summitracing.com/.  you should get yourself one of their catalogs.  I'm almost positive they're free, and it's the best bathroom reading ever printed.

If you are talking about the water line that feeds the refrigerator, I wouldn't suggest changing it to copper, simply because the plastic hose is more flexible and won't crack if bent in the same place repeatedly.If you are set on making the change, make sure that you can do so without pinching or kinking the copper line (this includes when you push your fridge back into place).  The copper fittings are similar to the plastic, as both plastic and copper line make use of compression type fittings.  Make sure to get the same size pipe as the old hose with the proper fittings.  You can get these by asking for assistance at most hardware stores.  You will need a reaming tool to make sure the copper pipe flares at the end and is smooth.  This may also be obtained at most hardware stores.  Then cut to the pipe to the proper length, make sure you have smoothed and flared both ends of your pipe, connect the pipe to the valve and the refrigerator, and make sure to tighten both fittings properly.Not very hard.  Make sure to watch your fittings for a while to make sure you don't have any leaks before pushing your fridge back in place.If you are referring to a different pipe then I would also say "good luck!" <SEP> how do I change the ice maker copper pipe in a refrigerator?

The problem is probably either close to where the wire enters the house foundation or where it connects at the well head. Make sure your testing correctly.If the house was built within the last 5 years, the back fill around the foundation has settled and put a lot of strain on the wire as well as the water pipe coming from the well. I would dig down 4 feet at the outside wall where the wire enters the foundation wall. However it's hard to believe that 12/2 Romex type wire would suffer enough tension force to break. Usually it's the water pipe that breaks at the wall and springs a leak. I'd recheck the voltage at the well head. <SEP> How can I find a break in an buried electrical wire without digging it all up?

Not easily. You have to take out the entire casing and be VERY careful about it.

I broke my pull cord about 3 weeks ago and had to do it. Fortunately it was right at the end so I didn't even need a new cord. Actually, I once broke a cord halfway up and rather than replacing it simply attached the handle to what was left and never had a problem starting it.Depends on the model, but the advice in the post above is generally right. The cord on most mowers goes thru a small hole on the top or side of the engine cover, around a narrow spool inside of it, and is kept there with a single knot on the other end (inside) of the spool thru a small hole in it. Thus remove the engine cover and when removing the spool observe how the cord is attached on the inside (if there is any left). The new one should obviously be attached the same way. It will probably be evident how the cord is attached on the inside. Winding on the new cord is a trick. You'll note that (if you didn't ruin anything) how there is tension when you turn the spool a certain direction. You want to wind the cord on in such a way so that when it is pulled it feels the tension as when you turn it with your hand. May have to hold in place with a straight screwdriver to accomplish that when winding and placing the end of the cord up thru the hole. The purpose of that is simply so that it returns to the engine cover after you pull it so you can try again. As little tension as necessary to accomplish that makes starting the engine easier. Hard to explain without illustrations for your model.Not easy but definitely doable - and once you learn how you wont have a problem doing so again. <SEP> how do i restring my lawn mower?

Wow, so many answers, so few correct.  It amazes me that so few people actually know how much air to put in there tires.  No disrespect to you, you are just asking the question.  The psi marked on the side of your tire is the max inflation that tire is rated at.  It should say something like "35 psi at 1300 lbs".  What this means is if your car weighs  5200 lbs you should run 35 psi according to the tire manufacturers specs.  If your car weighs 3500 lbs, 35 psi is to much to run.  There is actually a formula to use to calculate the proper inflation pressure if you are that critical about it.  My assumption is that you are not, you just want to know how much air to put in your tires.  If you check the id tag in your door jamb it will tell you how much your car weighs and how much air to put in the tires.  The only problem I have with this is that car manufactures tend to go on the low side with this because it gives you a smoother ride and may tend to prematurely wear out the tires but if it helps them sell cars they will tell you whatever they want.  It has already been said at least once, if you are just not sure, run them at 32 psi.  If you have a standard run of the mill car (any mid size or compact) this will be fine no matter what size tires you have.  I have a one ton truck with 10 ply tires on it, on the side of the tires it says "max inflation 80 psi at xxxx lbs".  (1800 or something)  Do I run 80 psi?  Heck no, I run them at 40 all day long.  If I am hauling a big load I jack them up to whatever I need to to handle the load.  I have a Durango with 31/10.50/15 6 ply's.  They say 50 psi max, I run them at 30, 35 if I am going on a long trip with luggage and such.  I have  a 70 Bug with 165/15's, I run them at 32 all the time.  I run my tire pressures according to my driving habits and comfort.  My Durango has some aftermarket suspension mods that already make it ride like a caddy so the softer tires make it even nicer.  I drive my bug pretty fast and where I live there are a lot of twisty roads and the higher pressure helps with the cornering and squeezes every bit of mileage out of the fuel.  The reason I tell you all of this is so you can see just how "uncritical" it really is.  Oh yeah, about the over inflation.  Your tires are most likely radials, they do look a little low on air all of the time, that is they way they are designed.  In the old days whey bias tires were the norm overinflation was a bad thing because of heat buildup.  You could actually blow a tire if it had to much air in it.  In radials that is pretty much out the window.  On average even on a hot day on hot asphalt you will gain only about 2-3 psi in your tires.  Not enough to worry about.  If your tires are overinflated by 5 psi it won't really hurt anything so don't lose sleep over it.  That is what radials are all about, they hold their form, they are made out of steel not nylon.  The two best pieces of advice I could give you would be this: always keep your tires evenly inflated and rotate them every 5000 miles.  I hope this lengthy answer has been helpful, I tried to be as informative as I possibly could without being too confusing. <SEP> How do I know how much air to put in car tires?

I will tell youTools Required:drill/driver, Phillips screw tip, level, pencil, and stepladder. And to make the job easier, use a screw holder extension in the screw gun, and a magnetic level.How to install / hang a curtain rod:(1) Tape 8 Â½â x 11â pieces of paper on the wall where the curtain rod mounts will go to prevent unnecessary marks on the wall. It is usually best to put the mounts close to the ends of the Drapery rod, so that you have as much space as possible between the mounts to stack your draperies. If your drapery rod is 120â long, you might center your mounts at 119â to utilize the entire length of the drapery rod. (2) Hold one curtain rod mount up and make sure it is high enough so that the curtains will cover the top of the window. Higher than the top of the window by a few inches may look better, and block out more light. Using a pencil, mark the location of the bottom screw hole on the paper and set the curtain rod mount down while you pre-drill a hole into the wall just deep enough to make it easy to drive the screw nice and straight. (3) Holding the curtain rod mount in one hand, and the screw gun in the other, drive the bottom screw into the wall. Level the curtain rod mount, and drive in the top screw. (4) Put the finials on the curtain rod, go to the other end of the curtain rod, lay the (magnetic) level on top of the curtain rod, hold the curtain rod and the curtain rod mount together and raise them up so the curtain rod is level, and the other end is sitting in the curtain rod mount that you have previously installed. (5) Repeat step 3 (6) Remove one finial, slide the rings onto the curtain rod, drop the curtain rod into place, and slide the curtain pins with curtains attached into the ring eyelets. (7) Remove one finial, slide the rings onto the drapery rod, drop the drapery rod into place, and slide the drapery pins with draperies attached into the ring eyelets. (8) Stand back, pat yourself on the back, and admire the quality and beauty of your new curtain rods made especially for you by Paso Robles Ironworks. How to install an extra long curtain rod:If you are installing an extra long curtain rod with a center connector and center mount, mark the center of the window, and install exactly as above, one side at a time. This means, temporarily install both finials on one of the curtain rod sections, and mount that first half as if it were a separate curtain rod. Then using the same half section with finials installed, proceed to step 4 and install the third mount. Now you are ready to put the entire curtain rod together and with a helper, and proceed to step 6. <SEP> how would i hang a curtain rod?

Take the spline and on one side, use the tool and push the spline and screen into the groove up the entire length, pull the opposite side tight and run the spline on that side the same way. Then, finish by doing the top and bottom the same way. It is best to get new gasket or spline. The old stuff, even though it masy not seem like it, does not have the elasticity to do this properly. <SEP> How do I properly replace the screen in my door?  It's the type with the channel and the tubular gray gasket. I already gave it a shot, but it's somewhat loose.  I'd like the job to look clean and sharp.  My local hardware store guy that always did this retired.  I enjoy fixing everything else around here, but this is one of those things I just never got around to learning the pro's technique.  I know there must be a simple step by step procedure for doing this.  I have lots of screen, the roller tool, and it seems the gasket still has plenty of grip - but let me know if I should replace that as well.Thanks in Advance;Curt
Strobe Lights can be purchased at many auto parts locations.  They are however, illegal to operate while the vehicle is in motion.  Impersonating an emergency vehicle.  To install one, you need to put it someplace where it won't get wet.  Most of them that I have seen, would simply drill a small hole on the inside of an existing turn signal housing.  Make it the same size or slightly larger than the strobe light itself.  Then you just put the strobe in the hole and seal with silicone to prevent water leakage.  Then wire it to a switch to turn on.  Basically it's as easy as installing a new light.  Like I said though, don't get caught using it on the road. <SEP> How do i install strobe lights on a car?

Don't accelerate too hard, soft press is enough in city conditions. Judge the crowd on the road and possible stoppages at traffic signals, avoid acceleration if possible. Ensure that your hand breaks are completely released and your wheels are free. You should not ride on your clutch pedal unnecessarily.Have your car serviced at regular intervals, particularly before and after rains.If you have to halt for more than two minutes, switch off the engine.Avoid giving to others your car for driving. Different handling cause damage to the vehicle operations.Try driving at the highest possible gear (no rash driving) at the earliest of each driving session.Driving vehicles for short distances cause more fuel consumption.

Get a cassette tool to remove the cassette. The axle should then unbolt easily from the hub. Are you sure you need new bearings? It should now be obvious where the bearings are (pay attention to which direction the sit in the hub). At this point, I would take the old bearings to a bike shop (assuming that they actually need to be replaced) and have the mechanic match your old bearings with some new ones. Don't forget to clean out any old grease from the hub and axle.

Kind of a long way to do it but it was the only way I can find.

As far as I saw it won't be an exact date so in my case it said a year, it could be anywhere from a year up to a year and 11 months. You still get an estimate of when you subscribed.

If you are hearing a siren sound instead of the horn honking, then you have an aftermarket alarm.  I'm guessing you don't have a key fob or you would have known you have an alarm, so it is possible that the previous owner installed an alarm and as most people do, lost the fobs and just never armed the alarm again.  When you changed the battery, it activated this aftermarket alarm.  Before I tell you ways to deactivate an aftermarket alarm, let me tell you about the factory alarm in your Cavalier.  Your Cavalier is equipped with the chevy passlock system.  In brief, there is an optical sensor in your ignition that recognizes the cut of your key to prevent theft.  There is an "Anti Theft" indicator light in your instrument cluster - this is why you think you have a factory alarm.  This light only indicates that you have the passlock system.There are a few ways to turn off an aftermarket alarm.  Without the key fob, all you can do is to put it into "valet mode" which is kind of like putting the system in hibernation.  First, disconnect your battery again, put the key in the ignition, turn the key forward to the on position (past the position where you can listen to the radio, and before all the way where your car would start cranking) and re-connect the battery.  If there is no siren, then turn the key forward and start the car.  Look for a red LED light somewhere on your dash to stay lit (not blinking).  It is now in valet mode and your car is as it was before you changed the battery before.  If this doesn't work,  some of the older aftermarket alarms can be disabled by turning the key to the on position and back to off and repeat for a total of three times. (with the battery connected) If both of those don't work you will need to find either a silver toggle switch or a small round black button - normally mounted somewhere under the dash around where your left foot would go.  Try to leave your finger on the button and turn the ignition forward to on, or with the ignition forward push the button (or flip the toggle switch).  As with the first method, you will know you have succeeded when the red LED stays on without blinking. Good luck.Once you have the car in valet mode, take the car to a stereo shop and have the alarm removed (unless you don't mind repeating the above whenever your battery dies or gets replaced).  Most shops will only charge you 1 hour labor to remove the alarm. <SEP> How do i Disable the factory Anti-theft system in my 99 cavalier.

The easiest way to check the coil pack when it is hot is to have a timing light with you and when it starts to Miss pull over and take out the timing light and put your ground leed on the neg side of the battery and then take the hot leed and go from spark plug wire to wire until you find the one that isn't lighting the timing light and that my friend is the coil that isn't working. <SEP> how do you tell the missing coilpac spark plug lead in car engine? i have a six cylinder 1994 nissan laurel [C34} with coilpac spark plug leads.When engine gets hot,it then misses.Any cheap way of d i y?prod leads etc. when engine starts to miss?
first indication is of course water or stains on your ceilings. see if the shingles are starting to curl up or if the surface of your roof appears uneven or bumpy. does the roof appear discolored in certain areas. also check in your gutters, are they full of little stones [a bit bigger then grains of sand]. these are all indications that you need to replace your roof. most shingles last 10-15 years with 20 years being the max. when replacing always strip off old shingles. never allow anyone to put new shingles over old. hope this helps. have a good day <SEP> How can I tell when my roof needs replacing?

While the car is idling, pull off the hose to the egr valve and hook up a vaccuum pump to the egr valve. When you pump it up the car should stall if the egr valve is fully functioning. If the idle doesn't change either the egr valve is stuck closed or the egr passages are so clogged with carbon no air can get through. If you have a scan tool and can get a DPFE voltage reading you should hook up the vaccuum pump to the egr valve and pump it while watching the DPFE voltage reading. If the idle changes but the DPFE sensor voltage reading does not change you know it is the sensor. Those sensors often go bad and so do the rubber hoses that are attached to them. <SEP> how do you know if the dpfe sensor is bad or if its the egr valve (2001 ford taurus)? getting a p401 code in the computer

There is no way you can tell if the companies can get access to your files, and given that they could probably bypass your password for login - it's likely that they could get to your files if they really wanted to.  The only way to be 100% sure that you alone have access to your files is to encrypt them or host the service yourself. In the latter case, you should be aware that any large company is probably going to be able to do backup and security better than you.  Finally - A company like dropbox has better things to do than to go through your files. I would suggest that for larger / more well known companies, your files will probably be safe. Firstly because their businesses rely on you trusting them and secondly, because you're just one account in a myriad of accounts. <SEP> Can I trust dropbox and similar services? [closed]

If the bearing is bad enough, it can cause your tire to tip in the back and cause undue stress on your braking components as well as other things.

You will need to remove either the throttle body or carb depending on what year the van is. The chain must be slung over the engine very close to the opening in the intake manifold, actually as tight as you can get it. When lifting you may need to use a pry bar to get the mounts clear of the frame brackets or unbolt them from the engine. I have done engine swaps several times on my Chevy work vans, the last being a 1992 model with the old body style. I assume you have taken the front of the van apart already?

hi, go to your local auto parts store and ask them if they have any 3M adhesives, like panel adhesives that will stick to all three materials. That is, aluminum, plastic, and fiberglass.

Depends on how the drawer is stuck... If it's stuck from age or swelling, etc. you can try removing the drawers directly below it and to the sides and see if it is open inside to where you can get to the drawer. If so, you might be able to see what's causing the jam or at least where it is. You can try using a small object as a prybar by wedging it behind the drawer and prying outward gently to free it. If there is something in the drawer that is getting caught against the front lip of the cabinet, try using your hand if there is enough clearance or the spatula if not, to pry downward on whatever is causing the jam and slide the drawer out.If you manage to get the drawer free and it is caused by sticking/swelling, rub some paraffin or candle wax along the area where the sticking occurs. It will help next time you face this problem. <SEP> How do I open a stuck drawer? The top middle drawer of my chest of drawers is stuck and I can't open it.

We went through the moisture problem and crawlspace vent issue years ago.  We found that there were conflicting opinions about vents, moisture barriers, sump pumps and proper ventilation. We were enlightened when we researched more.We found each home can have its own solutions but the moisture levels in the wood tell you much.  When moisture levels are over 20%, decay is inevitable but not rotting yet.  Moisture levels over 28% means the wood decay fungi is active (it feeds on the starch of your wood to rot it) and there is likely visible damage already.  Fungi and mold do not grow or become active if the levels are lower.  Generally, air flow keeps moisture levels down.Here is a Clemson University PDF home maintenance publication about moisture levels and control at :http://virtual.clemson.edu/groups/psapublishing/PAGES/FYD/HL255.pdf  Also NC State has one at http://www.ces.ncsu.edu/depts/fcs/housing/pubs/fcs486.htmlThis is good too.

Several years ago I saw a PBS series on oriental rugs and that guy had a show dedicated to cleaning. he used a mild dish soap, a soft scrub brush, buckets and a garden hose. He had a big concrete pad to use. I would avoid the driveway at least any area where there might be any grease. Clean it before you use it. He inspected the rug for damage and moth holes and larvae. He picked off any he could find.. both on the under side and top. He wetted it down and scrubbed gently any areas of lots of dirt. I would just take it a 3 foot section at a time until you're satisfied with the clean. Then rinse with lots of water. Make sure you scrub and rinse the back. I don't remember how he dried it but I don't see why a deck railing, clothes line (if it can handle it) or fence wouldn't' work well. If you need repairs, you will need a professional. <SEP> how to clean persian rug?
Several methods here depending on the size of the hole. Smaller holes can be patched with pre-mixed sheet rock mud. Sounds like youve got a bigger problem. If the hole is really big, cut the sheetrock so that the hole is rectangular. Cut, from a new piece of sheet rock you got from your favorite home improvement center, a "patch" that is approximately 1" bigger than the hole on all four sides. Use construction adhesive to glue the patch from the backside into the hole. You may need to hold this patch in place with sheetrock screws around the edges. When that's dry (give it some time!) cut another piece that just fits the hole, about an 1/8" smaller on all sides. Glue that over the backing you put in. Let that dry. Use sheetrock tape and mud to finish off the seams. Sand, texture and paint to match. This isn't a difficult project. You need a sharp knife, straight edge, some sheetrock, sheetrock mud, sheetrock tape, construction adhesive, sheetrock screws, screw driver, canned texture, sand paper, paint and a 4" - 6" putty knife. Let everything dry before moving on to the next step. <SEP> how do i repair a large hole in drywall?  what tools should i use?

Hi, first of all you need to pull the bonnet release lever from inside the car. On most Vauxhall's it is in the footwell area of the drivers seat, (if not, try the passenger side).It is a little lever about 4 inches/10 CM long close to the plastic side of the footwell. (the side nearest the door).once you have pulled this, get out of the car and go to the front of the car. the bonnet should now lift up a couple of inches. either look in the gap, or feel for the catch that is near the middle of the bonnet, but slightly to one side. The catch is "L" shaped, but upside down.You should be able to feel the catch and push it upwards and this will release the hooked end of the catch.Good luck   (And make sure you own the car or have the owners permission. lol). <SEP> how to open bonnet on a vauxhall cavalier 1990?
Easy to do if you are talking about painting black or grey trim. They make a special bumper and trim paint that is flexible so it works on plastic and expands and contracts with temperature. You can find it at any auto parts store (Advance Auto, etc).Preparation is the key to a good result. You need to go to the auto parts store and buy a paint preparation precleaner. Scrub your trim with soap and water and a plastic scrubby pad. Then rinse and dry and follow up with the paint prep product following label directions.Use masking tape and newspapers to mask off your trim so you don't get overspray on your paint. Use the bumper and trim paint according to directions. It goes on pretty well, and be careful not to put too much in one place.Done my trim and bumpers in two cars. Looks great and beats having to keep putting armor all on them. <SEP> How do you paint automobile trim?

One option to address dependencies that I've started using is leveraging the convert task to card and card link functions.  This expands on Ilari Kajaste's answer.  For example:   Create the parent card  Create a task list on the parent card - these tasks will become the child cards  Convert the tasks to cards (Click on the task to enter edit mode, click "Convert to Card" link  A new card will be created (using the same title as the converted task), and in it's activity notes will be a link back to the parent card.  I copy this link into the description or into a new checklist task for transparency - the original link may eventually be buried under later activity notes.  To tie child back to parent, click the "More" link at the bottom right hand corner of the child card and copy the shortcut link from the "Link to this Card" field  Navigate back to the parent card via the link in the activity notes (or closing the card and navigating manually) and add the child card link in the parent description, task list or other convenient place.   The owner of the parent card can check off the dependent tasks as they are completed.  This is straight forward using the links added in the last point above. Alternatively, the owner of one of the child cards can have a final task to navigate back to the parent card and check off the initial task.  A nice feature of this process is that if these child cards are later moved to another board, the links persist.  The product owner can create the relationships on a planning board, move cards willy nilly and still have easy access to and from those cards where ever they land.  Even if the manual copying / pasting of links is not completed, there will always be at least this one artifact of the original parentage in the child card.  The downside is there is at least one manual step (copying child card link to parent card) to create a solid relationship, but overall is a good alternative to the more management heavy processes such as maintaining separate "waiting" lists and describing the dependent cards. <SEP> How do you handle dependencies between cards with Trello?

I started a job like this once and had half the lino up before I learned that you can just go over it with the new floor.

You will need to remove the tile surrounding the area, clean off the backs of each tile.  Remove as much of the old leveler as possible with a scrapper.
