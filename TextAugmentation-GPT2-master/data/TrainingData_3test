If you still have the user manual for your car, it will have specific instructions.  However, here are some general guidelines:Take the hubcap off the flast tire, and use the lug wrench to loosen the lugnuts.  The lugwrench should be near the spare tire, and may even double as the handle of the jack.Once you've loosened the lugnuts, place the jack under the frame of the car near the flat tire, and jack up the car.  You can stop when the flast tire is off the ground.Take off the lugnuts, and put them in the hubcap so you don't lose them.Pull the flat tire off the wheel.  You may have to jiggle it a little.Put the new tire or donut, making sure that it fits snugly.  Put the lugnuts back on, and tighten them.  Don't make them too tight, as someday you may need to take this tire off.Lower the jack, put it back in your trunk, and drive away.Don't throw out the flat tire, you may be able to get it fixed at a gas station for as little as $5. <SEP> how to change a tire?

Sometimes gutters are inadequately designed for the load. You may need to increase the gutter size to a 6" wide system. Otherwise make sure that the gutter is set at the right elevation to the lowest shingles, and is mounted firmly to the facia (years of wear may allow the gutter to sag outward, and away from the roof edge).  A very long run of gutter will have the low end too far below the edge of the roof to catch a big rain. If that is likely, you may need to divide the run to go in both directions from the middle (You'll need to remove and reset the gutter to have the high point in the middle.

Assuming you are following the welder's instructions, you only need a 3 wire plug (2 hot plus ground) and that is what you have.

A blue wire is tied off (per the welders instructions).  That leaves a brown L1 wire and a black L2 wire, they are both hot.My question is...which of the remaining two straight prongs on the plug are hot?  Is it the tall blade (1/2"), short blade (5/16"), or both?  Which blades should the brown and black wire go to?  The welders instructions show nothing connected to a neutral wire.  The plugs instructions just show the green wire going to the ground, and 2 other wires going to the other two blades.

most likely, you have lost the ground to the outlet thru the cord or plug. The ground from the motors is doing what it is supposed to do, it is grounding to the frame.

Usually I can tell how much my clutch is worn by how far the clutch pedal comes off of the floor before it engages with the flywheel.  The more it wears, the closer to the top of its stroke it will be before the clutch pedal engages.  Also, you will lose free play in your clutch.  Free play is when you can  feel that the clutch pedal is easy to push towards the floor, before you feel resistance. The resistance is the clutch starting to release from the flywheel.

I will agree with just about every body's answer.  Most pump on whirlpools are nylon impellers or bronze, which both of them should not produce rust.  If your water heater is rusting out it could be the problem, draining will only last a while.  If you happen to have galvanized pipe of a piece of black pipe in you water system this could cause rust. If you go to other fixtures in your house and get rust out of them it could be that.  It could also be from the water main it self, which is a city or if your on a well a problem at the source.

If there are no shut offs for the bathroom fixtures, then you may have to shut off the incoming water service from the street, road, etc.; it is usually right near the water meter.  This will shut off the water to the whole house.  Then open the faucet at the lowest point of the house, then one at the highest point of the house, it will drain to the lowest point.  Do what you have to do, then shut the lowest point faucet off.  Open the incoming water valve, slowly, with the highest point still open; this will purge any air in the pipes.  Check for leaks.  If all is OK, then let the high point run for a little while to get the air out.

The Others answers do contain some good advice.1. Unless you like fighting a continuous battle, you need to correct the cause of the damp wall. [inspect the plumbing inside for leaks ( in some areas of the country copper pipes erode from the chemistry of the water), look at the gutters, possible high ground-water, poor surface drainage outside the house (which is what I'd bet on) , or more remotely a broken water line outside]2. Bleach will kill an active fungus, but bleach evaporates and does not offer a long lasting deterrent.3. Positive Air circulation will discourage mold and fungus, will aid in drying the wall, but may be tough for some basements, and fresh air is just not practical in the colder months.4. DO NOT PAINT the wall until you have solved the moisture problem. The paint will not adhere for very long to any surface that is continuously or periodically wet.5. Dehumidification is the most common solution, but a dehumidifier is nothing more than an air conditioner with all the parts running inside. It consumes energy, and is not a good long term solution. You will always have to remember to empty the water [unless you have a pump instsalled to run the water to the utility sink or outside as some AC systems have].6. A safe chemical that will kill and prevent mold and fungus, (besides killing chewing insects such as termites) is Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate (NA2 B8 O13 - 4H20).  It comes in a powder form, and has no noxious fumes, but is not recommended for applications where there is running water (situations that would wash the material away).

It seems to be on a video by video basis. Your 'create a spaceship' tutorial will buffer when paused, but your 'create a city' tutorial will not.

Provided you're really dying to exchange with user user_test   Display the public activity page of the user:  https://github.com/user_test?tab=activity  Search for an event stating "user_test pushed to [branch] at   [repository]" . There are usually good chances, he may have pushed one   of his own commits. Ensure this is the case by clicking on the "View    comparison..." link and make sure the user is listed as one of the committers.  Clone on your local machine the repository he pushed to: git clone   https://github.com/..../repository.git  Go to that directory cd repository  Checkout the branch he pushed to: git checkout [branch]  Display    the latest commits: git log -50   As a committer/author, an email should be displayed along with the commit data.

Umm, it weighs the same at any speed.What you may be referring to is the forces on the con rod and crank/bearings, which has little to do with centrifugal force :-) You're looking at a linear braking and acceleration, at each end of the piston travel, so you'd need to know how fast it's traveling up and down the bore... except that's not linear, since the crank is offet, so the piston speed varies over the length of it's travel.You might want to try laying out a series of 1:1 drawings to get the dimensions involved,  then go from there <SEP> How do you figure the weight of an engine piston at a certain RPM?

Not quite sure what you are asking-but here goes.HVAC systems can contribute to poor indoor air quality.#1.It is a moist, dark environment that is prime place for mold growth.#2.It merely recycles the air in the structure-it does not bring in fresh air.#3.The "filter" does little more than take out the big particles in the air.These particles are dead skin flakes,dust mites,insect parts,etc....The filter does not remove or kill bacteria,volatile organic compounds (formaldehyde,solvents,benzene)The filter just traps things on it so mold spores have something to feed on.The list goes on,but this should be a start.I could tell you more if you're interested. <SEP> how can HVAC systems be corrolated to IAQ?

If the battery is showing fully charged from the charger but runs out quickly or does not charge at all, I would suspect a bad battery.  Take a multimeter and read voltage (Make sure the meter is set to DC!).  No matter the charge on the battery the voltage should remain the same... to check the charger, put the battery in series with the charger/meter( this time turn the meter to Ampere setting 10A max first - if you get nothing, then you can adjust to the mA setting) and you should get a corresponding reading to the manufactures specs.NiCd (Nickle Cadnium) and Li-Ion (Lithium Ion) have dissimilar characteristics on charging rituals...e.g.  NiCads like to be FULLY discharged before recharging - this lengthens the life of the battery while if you truly discharge a Li-Ion, you'll probably never be able to use it again.Also, schwinn products might be sold at walmart.  Or where ever you may purchase another battery save the receipt, and take the bad one back.good luck <SEP> how do i fix my schwinn scooter it says its charged and does not charge?

To properly bleed a boiler takes time and Patience. Your boiler should have an auto fill valve to let water in. Hopefully you also have boiler drains on each zone. These drains will have a connection to hook up a garden hose. Direct the garden hose to a drain in the floor, or somewhere that will get rid of the water. Caution, this water is not only hot(180-200 Degrees) but can be very black as well, so choose carefully were you drain to.Turn one of your t-stats up so the zone you are working on comes on, you can feel the hot water by placing your hand on the pipe, again be care full, it is very hot. if the zone is open but not flowing, slowly opening the drain should push the air lock through. do not open or drain the zone to quick, you do not want to let the boiler go dry, bad things happen then. When you feel the hot water come back to the boiler through the pipe you know you have flow. You can hear the air in the pipes as it circulates and open the drain slowly to purge the air out. You need to do this to each and every zone in the system.It is advisable to have an experienced HVAC tech. do this if you are not comfortable, and watch him, ask questions. This is your system, you should know how and why it works. Good luck. <SEP> how do you bleed the boiler?

The center terminal on the plug, indeed, needs to be connected to the white wire and the red and black wires to the side terminals.  You need to connect a ground wire preferably green from someplace on the stove to the grounding connection on the plug.  The stove will work just fine without it but if something goes wrong with the internal wiring of the stove, the chassis could become "hot" and the breaker wouldn't trip.  Should that happen, you could get shocked with 120 V when you touch the range and something that is grounded at the same time.  Probably won't happen but it has and, once in a great long while, something bad happens.  Have a good turkey. <SEP> How do I wire the power cord on an range to change from a 4-prong cable to a 3-prong cable? My home has a 3-prong electric outlet for the range and my new stove came with a 4-prong cable.

So I bought a 3-prong cable...My confusion is that the 4-prong cable has color coding (white,red,black, and green-for ground), but the 3-prong cable doesn't.How do I connect the new 3-prong cable? I heard that the "white" cable (happens to be in the middle of the three cables in my range) has to connect with the middle of the cables in the 3-prung cable.  Is that correct?I was also told that because there is no fourth cable, to leave the grounding screw alone in the range (where the green cable used to be connected).Any help appreciated. I need to connect this range soon or there will be no turkey for Thansgiving :-)Thanks much!Jose

If the engine takes too long to heat up then it probably is a bad thermostat. Watch the temp Gage and see if the temperature is in the proper range when the temperature gets up to the proper operating temp then the thermostat will open up letting the water circulate through the engine.You can tell when this happens as you may be able to hear the thermostat click and followed by a sudden and temporary drop in temperature as the cooler water from the radiator starts going through the engine and the warmer water from the engine goes to the radiator to be cooled by the fan also you may sense a sudden and temporary drop in engine speed when the fan kicks in . <SEP> How do I know when to change the thermostat or know when it isn't working?? I flushed my radiator about three times until water was clear and then refilled with half and half, coolant/distilled water. I did this because it hadn't been done since I bought the truck ('95 Ford Ranger, 107K miles) from a neighbor two years before, plus the fact that the truck's coolant temp gauge needle was going past the middle mark but not all the way into "H." Afterwards, it was a little better, but it still happened once in a while for long trips on the highway. Just changed the air filter w/ a K&N filter and strangely things seemed to improve, but the needle still moves a little past the middle. I don't know what else to do. So, I'm wondering about the thermostat...
I work for a Natural Gas Company.  The advice we give people is to cut back your thermostat to about 65 degrees while you are up and around 60 degrees while you are sleeping.  Insulating your windows and doors also helps.  You can get that clear window plastic at Wal-Mart pretty cheap and it is very effective.  Make sure you don't have any drafts and if you do, stop them up with something.  Wearing sweatpants and sweatshirts while lounging around helps.  When you are cooking, cut back your thermostat too.  Your oven should warm up your house pretty well also. <SEP> How can I save on heating in an apartment? I am living in a two bedroom apartment in the midwest.

One word of advice, when it comes to airbag repair, if you don't know what you are doing, DON'T! If you still wish to dive further, consult a factory manual! Also, other parts need to be replaced such as the sensor that caused it to go off. If you replace the airbags and not the other parts, you risk the new bags going off. Not pretty! Again, make sure you replace everything you need to, some cars you even need to replace the airbag module as well. Please be careful! <SEP> how do you pull the air bags out of a suzuki grand vitara? driver side and passenger side are blown need to pull and reinstall new bags
the windshield in a car is actually two pieces of glass with a layer of polimer in the middle to keep the shield from breaking in large pieces in case of impact. This makes it harder to control the temperature of the glass on the outside as well as the inside. Fog ,during rain,on the inside only indicates the shield is a different temperature on the outside. The automotive industry uses defrosters to control the temperature of the glass thus giving a clearer view threw the glass. My advice would be to find out why the defroster wasnt giving me the proper results. If you choose to use a chemical, then rain-x  is about the best and can be used both on the inside of the shield and the outside. Rain-x can be found  at any walmart store and will be cheaper there rather than an auto parts store.      good luck <SEP> How to keep the inside of my car windshield from fogging up?

Describing how to change a timing belt here is not practical. But try your local library for auto repair manuals (a very good one is "How to keep your VW alive", but I don't know if there is an edition for a 95 golf).

A maintenence lite is different than a check engine light. The maintanence lite is usually just an indicator telling you that the preset mileage that you are nearing or have reached is due. generally it means that you are do for your oil and filter to be changed. But just changing your oil does not put out the light. You should have a button on your dash for the tripmeter. With the engine off, push the button in, then turn the key to on power with the button still being held in. You should see the mainteneance lite flash or blink. Let go of the button after a few flashes and start the engine. The lite should now be off and reset until the next time that you are do for the oil change. And by the way, if you havent changed the oil recently, do so now. Your light will come back on in a few thousand miles again, just repeat what i told you here and you will be fine.Good Luck, and i hope you can teach someone else what you mastered. <SEP> How do you turn off the dashboard needs maintenance light on 2000 Accord?

Several things can cause head gasket failure. If you remove the head to replace the gasket (which you have to do anyway) you will know if the head (or block for that matter) is cracked.

You are probably going to have to wait for the wood to dry out.  But to expedite the process get one of those containers by DampRid that has the granules in it to absorb moisture.  Place it in the room along with some oscillating fans.  The DampRid will absorb the moisture out of the air coming from the wood.  Don't put the granules on the wood, just leave it open near to where the spill occurred.Then, once you are certain you have thoroughly dried out the wood, try to use Howards Restore-a-finish in a color similar to your floor.  Because of the variation in parquet flooring, you may need to purchase two different colors.  Fornby's also has a kit you can use, if you cannot find Howards.   Neither one will harm your floor, but if you have warpage as a result of the volume of water, you may be looking at replacement of that area. <SEP> How do you care for wood parquet floors after water has been spilled on them?

Obtain a new one from your dealer or other trusted source.  I believe the MAF is located next to your airbox on the right side of the engine, you'll see it clipped in just before where the intake connects to the airbox.  Just remove it, rewire and replace.  Although for a car like the S80 I would suggest that you take it to a dealer.  I just had mine replaced because the check engine light came on.  I also had to replace the two 02 sensors.  All three of those componenents replaced and STILL the bloody light won't go away.  Ah well, that's my problem.

There are two ways: at the city water meter, you need a "meter key" wrench. There are a couple of types - if the valve has a tab on top, you need the key that looks like a fork at the end, and if it's a square nut, you need the one that looks like a lug wrench on the end. Either of those cost six or seven dollars at the hardware store. The easier way is to locate the place inside the house (probably the basement or crawl space where the water pipe comes in. There's usually a valve there you can just turn off with your hand. A final thought is that the water lines leading to the bath tub probably have valves along the way somewhere. Tracing them down isn't always easy, but a huge number of them will be inside an access panel in the linen closet or a closet in the room next to the bathroom. Good luck! - Stuart <SEP> How do I turn off the water to my house? Obviously nobody knows my house specifically, but what do I look for?

Wish I could be more encouraging but once the paint is absorbed it's pretty well impossible to get it out. It's kind of like the paint and the brick have become "one". However, you could try Muriatic Acid. It's not expensive and you'll find it at some hardware stores. You'll need protective gloves and a face shield. This is strong stuff so best to use as directed on the container. But first use a regular paint stripper to remove as much surface paint as possible.

All these folks wanting you to dis-connect your battery while the car is running didn't offer to pay for the "fried" electronics did they? Don't do that, it can cause ECM and component failure! The other suggestions are good, the best is drive to AutoZone and let them test it free!You can do this test yourself though.

First before you take off the belt make sure you have a belt diagram.  If you can't find it in the engine compartment then you have to draw one.  Your 15 minute job can turn into a hour or more if you don't have one.  If you dont know where the tensioner that keeps the belt tight is pull on the belt and look for a pulley that moves.  Get a wrench or rachet depending on what is there to move the pulley.  Just pry the tensioner and slide the belt off a pulley.  I would recommend you to take off the tensioner it is only one bolt.  If it squeeked when moving it replace it while you have it off.  Also look at a new one and compare the pulleys if it looks like it is seperating replace it.  Also spin the pulley.  If it makes any noise replace the pulley.  Also check all other pulleys especially idler pulleys if they make any noises or wiggle some replace them too.Now to put the belt on use you diagram and route the belt accordingly.  Leave a smooth pulley if you can for last.  Take your wrench and pry the tens. and slipe the belt on the last pulley.  Now check to make sure you belt is straight on all pulleys.  One groove off will destroy you belt in minutes.  Maybe have someone bump the engine while you look at the belt and if at 3 times all is ok then start it.  Walaa you done.Hope that helps.By the way I do like soccer.Todd <SEP> how to install drivebelt 1996 cadillac deville?
I'm going to assume you are talking about the copper lines that run between the indoor and outdoor units.  The only line that needs to be wrapped is the suction line, the bigger of the two, which will also be the cold one of the two.  Try Home Depot, or a store like that, ask for pipe insulation; you will need to know the outside diameter of the pipe for the type you can slide over the pipe.  If you can't do it that way, ask for a roll of cork or tar-like insulation wrap.  You simply unroll the wrap at an angle around the pipe, keeping it somewhat taught, andoverlapping it a little for whatever length you need.  It is plyable enough that you can kind of mold it to the pipe.  This will prevent the cold pipe from sweating and getting a layer or buildup of frost. <SEP> how do you wrap the freon line of an air conditioner?

i had soil under my floor.  jack up the floor with a hydraulic jack.  on the joist, put a piece of angle iron between the jact tip and the joist.  then i take a small stepping stone block (like a cinder block, but flat) and place it under where it will be braced.  i cut a piece of 2x8 and use a special metal fastener to screw it onto the joist.  then i lower the jack about 1/4" to where the floor is level and the wood is sitting on the cement pad. <SEP> how to jack up floors?
If only the floor finish itself and not the wood has been stained you can use an extra fine nylon rubbing pad with a good oil soap to remove just enough floor finish to get the mark out.

MSD makes a box for that. I'ts the MSD 6A. try increasing the spark and you can run a bit leaner. If you look at the Hemi engine you'll see its built for flow. think about having the heads port and polished. also getting the valves turned. The less work load the engine has the less heat it will in retrospect have to produce. when your fuel is delivered it may also be sent up from the frame rail around the motor. Lean away from heat conducting hoses I.E. braided lines. Let the carb atomize the fuel not the hose. Change the carb and intake manifold. For your application I would use Edelbrock gear.

As a mechanic, I'm going to give you some very good advice, so read carefully. If you have to ask the question in the first place, TAKE IT TO A MECHANIC! Brakes are the ONE THING a novice has NO business messing with, more than any other component of the automobile. If you want to learn about your car, I commend and support you.

If I remember right, most older GE dryers do not have removable back panels. The front panel comes off instead. There is srews at the bottom of the front panel at floor level. After you remove those, pull the bottom outward a ways. From there, you can disengage it from the top, and have access to the area under the drum where the motor and belt tensioner pulley assembly is located. On GE dryers that open like this, the back of the drum is mounted to a shaft that goes through a bearing in the back of the dryer accessible through a small removable panel. The front of the drum rides on 2 plastic shoes mounted to the front panel. Check the bearing, guide shoes, and tensioner pulley. I have had to replace the tensioner pulley, since it is plastic, it wears out somewhat quickly, or cracks and breaks loose from its center shaft. Hope this helps. <SEP> How do I remove the back panel of my GE dryer?

Quote: "Squeaky doors can be a real nuisance. Fortunately, there are several very easy fixes for this common problem. Here are some tips...Try spraying a little WD-40 (TM ) oil directly into the door hinges, with the door still attached. Operate the door to check and see if that eliminated the squeak...If the door still squeaks, apply a little powdered lubricant (e.g., powdered graphite) inside the hinge (/ squeaky part)...If you don't have any powdered lubricant, you could try using some household materials that you may have handy. Try rubbing petroleum jelly or candle wax on the hinge...repeat these steps on the other hinge(s) if necessary.

clamp down on the bolt head if you can, if not, grab the back side of the shaft w/ vise grips and force it off.

Depends on what the juice is and what material the carpet is made from.

I have faced the same problem.  Rent or buy a pressure washer.  It will quickly remove the mildew and dirt build up.  You will be amazed at how good your concrete walks will look.  The only problem is that the mildew will return over time.  Of course you cannot change the climate in which you live, but you can take some steps to minimize the reoccurance.  Mildew likes damp and shady areas that are not subject to constant drying winds.  Trimming trees and shrubs to expose the walks to sunlight will help.  Correcting drainage problems will also help.  If none of these options are available, consider the purchase of a pressure washer.  An electric homeowners model can be had for under $150.00.  You can then keep the mildew at bay as needed.With all due respect to the other people who have answered this question, bleach is not a good solution.  It is messy, smells bad, and is harmful to your landscaping.  It is also a temporary fix since rain water simply rinses it away over time.  It can also stain your concrete if applied too strong.Good luck with your mildew problem. <SEP> how do you get mildew off a concrete walkway?

Dude -- I hate to be rude, but let's start with the basics. First, clean your house. I don't mean straighten out the junk, I mean CLEAN. Throw stuff away. Use Pinesol (it comes in scents, now, not just that pine tar smell) or some other type of cleaning agent that does not require rinsing (the underlying pine scent helps repel all types of critters). Clean out under all your sinks (bath and kitchen) and throw away anything that is not absolutely required. Close up all holes in all walls -- such as where pipes come in under sinks and behind gas ranges (rats and mice love crawling along hidden pipes -- they are a veritable rodent raceways).  Check also behind your 'fridge, particularly if you have an icemaker (the water source has to come from some where). Ensure your dryer vent has some way of closing when not in use (there a lot of options available at every hardware store). Find, dry and repair the source of all water leaks -- those buggers really need and seek out water (there might be a double whammy if there is a leaky pipe hidden in a wall or ceiling -- that just needs fixing).  That includes emptying the drip tray under your fridge.  Those buggers can live under that fridge in the warmth drinking from that drip tray. Repair all openings in the siding of your house -- those buggers are getting in somewhere.  Repair or replace all screen doors (I had a 3lb rat get into my house because I left the door wide open on a beautiful spring day. The rat died...so did my dog.) Put your food away. No opened food containers on the counter, stove or fridge. Make sure all of the "water traps" are filled in all of your unused bathrooms and toilets (those are the things that keep the sewer gases out of your house, if they dry out they provide an open source for rodents and insects to come in from the sewer (yuck).Now, once you've closed all means for the buggers to get in (and out) it's time to kill those that you have. If you don't mind the smell of putrifying rodent bodies, go ahead and lay out some DCon -- BUT NOT IF YOU HAVE KIDS OR PETS.  I prefer the old fashioned "clap-traps." They may be a bit primative, but you don't have rodent carcasses fermenting in places you can't see.  I usually bait the traps with peanut butter and throw the whole thing away once I capture a bugger. If you reuse the traps, you may have boil them to get the smell of the dead one off the trap otherwise you may not catch another one.  Put the traps in corners that are out of the way but are visible enough to see if they caught anything. Keep the bait facing away from the corner. If rats are infesting your house, you may have to fill all of the holes with a combination of broken glass (use broken beer bottles) and steel wool. The rats will chew thru vertually any other material, so the glass/steel wool will act as a rodent barrier underneath the cosmetic caulk or foam filling the hole. You'll get rid of them all if you are merciless and relentless. As nasty as it is, you'll just have go on a full scale attack. Good luck. <SEP> How do I get rid of rodents in my house without having to actually touch one or even see one?

Installing 3-way SwitchesFrom Apply Now,Your Guide to Home Repair.You can turn the lights on here and off over there, and you can do it yourself once you know the trick. It's not exactly simple, but it's far less complicated than most people assume. There are two important things to remember to make 3-way switches work right. One is that the switches are really single-pole, double-throw devices. That means that one of the three terminals on each switch is always connected to one of the other two. The terminal that is always connected is called the point terminal. It should be specially identified. Most commonly, the screw for the point terminal will be dark and the other two screws will be bright. Toggling - flipping - a 3-way switch changes which of the other two terminals the point terminal is connected to. To help visualize this, you can think of a 3-way switch as a "V." The bottom of the V is the point terminal and the top of the letter is where the other two terminals are. Each time the switch is flipped, the wire terminated on the point is disconnected from one of the other two terminal screws and connected to the other. The other important thing to remember is that 3-way switches come in pairs. It takes two of them, and only two, to make the system work. In addition, three-way switching works because the two non-point terminals on one of the 3-way switches are always connected directly to the two non-point terminals on the other 3-way switch with a pair of wires called the travelers. A three-conductor cable - with or without a ground wire - connects the two switches and carries the two travelers. The third insulated conductor in the three-conductor cable is used as a hot wire or as a neutral, depending on which is needed. In every 3-way switch system, the ungrounded conductor from the panel - the "hot" wire - is connected to the point terminal on one of the two switches. The switch-controlled "hot" wire, which connects the switch system to the first controlled light, is connected to the point terminal on the other switch. The grounded conductor - the neutral wire - is not switched. It is carried to the first light and connected there. There are three scenarios that cover more than 90% of all three-way switch installations. One of these should work for you in a new installation. If you're troubleshooting existing wiring, one of these will most likely be what you are looking at. Remember to turn the power OFF at the panel before starting. For a new installation, remember to use #12 AWG (American Wire Gauge) wire on a 20 amp circuit. You can use #14 AWG wire on a circuit protected at 15 amps. <SEP> How do I hook up a three way switch?

The obvious answer for me is to shift the car into neutral and then use the brakes.  Brake pad replacement is one heck of a lot cheaper than a clutch replacement and that's not the only thing that wears on on the transmission!Everytime you shift gears you exercise the syncromesh  associated with each forward gear.  Reverse generally doesn't need any such syncromesh which is why sometimes it is difficult to get into reverse.The clutch throw-out bearing is given a large break too when you leave that clutch pedal out as much as possible.  In that possition the throw-out bearing is not being used.  Held down to the floor, the throw-out bearing is working it's tail off!When the transmission is in neutral the engine speed decreases to idle speed, around 800 rpm.  At that point I am using very little fuel while the ground under the tires is still passing under the car pretty quickly.  That translates to fuel economy!  A quick kick up in rpm and I can put it in any gear I want.The only reason I can give for downshifting through your deceleration is to gain the capacity for a quick acceleration.  That is easily solved with some defensive driving techniques and it really isn't that slow shifting into whatever gear I want when I need it anyway!My '90 Honda Prelude has 230,000 miles on it's original clutch!  The only thing that has been replaced is the clutch acutation parts since that is controlled by hydraulics with a master and a slave cylinder similar to the brake system. <SEP> How do you stop when you drive manual transmission car? Using the brake or Downshifting. Are not you concern about your transmission more then your brake pads considering the difference in their price.

The horizontal chalk line keeps the rows in a straight line while the vertical chalk line keeps the courses square in an upright straight line.  The horizontal chalk line measurement is the width of a shingle which is 13 3/8". The rake chalk line gives roofer a guideline to follow when cutting off the excess shingle overhang. To start the horizontal chalk line, find a comfortable and safe location near the lower end of roof along the fascia board roof line and with measuring tape, mark 12 3/8" from edge of overhang up.  Although the shingle width is 133/8" wide, 12 3/8" is used to obtain a one-inch shingle overhang over facsia board and rakes. (barge board)  Do the same to opposite end and connect the two marks with a chalk line strike. Repeat the process to the rake chalk line which is up the incline roof surface on both ends.  The rake chalk line has the same measurements as the horizontal chalk line (12 3/8" plus one inch for overhang) To mark the vertical chalk line use the shingle length (39 3/8") as the measurement, but mark 38 3/8" instead (allowing one inch for shingle overhang again) from edge of plywood (rakes) inward along the horizontal chalk line at the lower end and top end along the ridge.  Use chalk line and snap a line between the two points, but extend the chalk line pass the horizontal line all the way down to the edge of fascia line to get a complete line. Before shingles are nailed in place the vertical and horizontal chalk line must be perpendicular or at right angles ( 90 degrees) to each other. Check the lines for square by using the Pythagorean theorem of 3:4:5 method.  In a right angle triangle with sides of 3, 4, and 5, the sum of square 3 and 4 is equaled to square of hypotenuse which is 5. eg: 3x3=9       4x4=16       5x5=25 On an average roof inclined surface of 16 feet, double or tripple the 3:4:5 method for larger measurements to check roof square - 6:8:10 or 9:12:15. Where the two lines intersect, measure four feet up the vertical line and place a mark (labeled A) and on horizontal line measure three feet out from intersecting point and mark B.  The distance between point A and B should measure five feet.  If the measurement is more or less than five feet then adjustments would have to be made. <SEP> how do i mark a roof off to shingle my house? ive been told i need two vertical lines?

Use a chlorine solution to wash down the porch, in areas where the mold/mildew is heaviest use a more concentrated solution.After washing it down use a paint or stain to protect the wood.You also may want to check and make sure that none of the boards are rotten before you treat the porch and replace them.You can do this by tapping them with a hammer, first get a new piece of wood, tap it so you know what it sounds like then tap the porch boards and make sure you get a solid thunk instead of a subdued squish. <SEP> How do I control mold/mildew on a wood porch?

Easy. Change pads? Disc or rotor. First remove the tire/rim. Sometimes they are stuck on so have a deadblow hammer handy.On rotor brakes the calipers must be removed from the rotors. The pads should pop right out. You may need a C-clamp to push the caliper piston in, so have one of those handy too. Replace the pads just as you found the others.For drum brakes, the drum head must be removed. I have found drum brakes easier to change once you have access to the pads.The only other thing to be done besides changing lines if you have a leak, is to bleed the brakes. You need two people for this.One person behind the wheel, and the person at the wheel well releases the nipple on the caliper. Person at wheel pushes brake to floor. You do this several times until you have good brake pressure. Don't forget to retighten the bleeder nipple you loosened. This gets rid of water and air in the lines.Make sure you have plenty of brake fluid in the resevoir.Not too sure what you meant by repair them.....if this doesn't cover it maybe you can be more specific. If you feel this is over your head, just take it to a mechanic. Changing the brake pads or getting brake service done isn't too expensive. <SEP> How do i repair my car brakes?

Rinse with tap water using a spray bottle, blot to remove excess moisture.Spray lightly with water, do not blot this time; apply pad of paper towels and brick and allow to dry.If there is still some stain on the carpet and blotting is not removing it, then moisten the tufts in the stained area with 3% hydrogen peroxide.

Look for a clean out by the side of the building.

If you can get a sewer rod and go down the clean out until it stop you should stop where it enter the septic tank.

When the pump system is water logged, you have lost the capacity in the tank itself. One way to check it is look for a "water line" on the tank if it is a metal tank. If the ater is cold enough, you will see condensation form at the level of the water. If it is a fiberglass tank, let the pump pump up to pressure and shut off. Make sure nothing is using water in the house or building. Get a 5 gallon bucket and put it under a faucet and open the faucet. Count the gallons it takes before the pump comes back on. If the pump comes on immediately, the system is definitely water logged. Most tanks have a 5 to 20 gallon drawn down gallons, or the gallons that it puts out before the pump comes back on. To "un-water log" the tank, drain the tank down all the way and fill it back up. The pump should add air to the tank as it pumps. The is also some kind of air volumn control either on the tank or in the well piping. Make sure it is working properly and letting air out or adding air, depending on the style of control. Hope this helps! Good luck! <SEP> How do you tell if your water tank is water logged and what are the symptoms of the water well pump if this oc
If you threw a rod your car may still run. I am a mechanic and I have recent replaced 2 motors that threw rods and they both ran. One was in a ford and it had a big hole in the side of the block. You could look in one side of the block and see out the other. The other was a chevy and when I took the oil pan off there was pieces of the rod laying in the oil pan. If you threw a rod and the car runs it will shake really bad and probably knock very loud. If the car won't run than you will have to put a wrench on the crankshaft pully bolt and see if you can turn the motor over by hand. either way you will have to pull the oil pan off to see what it looks like inside. <SEP> How do you know if you threw a rod in your car?
1. Get a pair of tweezers or an old small scissors in order to lift long hair out from the drain, or whatever may be causing the clog.  Try running hot water down the drain, and see if it goes down quickly.  If it is still too slow, and collecting in the tub, try putting a half-cup of baking soda in the drain, then pour a half-cup of vinegar immediately afterwards.  Then rinse with water.2. Another way to unclog a tub is to use chemical products such as Drano or LiquidPlumr.  Just don't use vinegar and then use the chemical product at the same time! 3.  Have you tried using a plunger?  This may also work.  Move the plunger in an up-and- down motion quickly, loosening the clog as you go. If everything didn't work, call a professional to snake the drain, and remove the entire clog from the drain. <SEP> How to unclog a tub?

You basically remove the scratches  by buffing or polishing them out. polishing tools are available at any large automotive store. Make sure you use paper and masking tape to protect the trim and paint area around the windshield and to make clean-up lots easier.If you cant find it or dont want to risk something like that, you can send your car to a car wash or for servicing. The mechanics there will have the tools required.Bad news:  If your scratches are deep you will not be able to polish them out and a new windshield is your only solution. "Deep" means if your fingernail "catches" when you run it sideways over the scratch--it is probably gonna be too deep to polish out. As a last resort you could consult with a automotive glass speciality shop in your area for their opinion..it should be free, but don't be suprised if they want to sell you a windshield.Good luck.Arvind <SEP> how do you get scratches out of car glass windows? the scratches arent very deep but very noticable. please help!

A lot of raised wood floors or second stories are built using the least amount of materials allowed to save on costs.  That frequently leaves a floor that, while capable of supporting its load, squeeks because the wood is flexing a lot.  If this is a second story you may just want to learn to live with it because it will be a lot harder to fix it then you may think.  If it is on the first floor of a house with a raised wood floor you ban reinforce without really tearing a lot of things up in your house.  There should be a crawl space opening somewhere to get in the underfloor space.  Once you are inside there you can add additional lumber to the joists to help them support the loads.  A handyman or contractor can do this fairly easily and would be better suited to climb under there and determine where the extra support should be located. <SEP> how do i repair the creaking our of hardwood flooring? hardwood flooring that creeks how do i repair?

In a car or are you talking about a residential water pump?For a residential water pump, you have to take like a gallon container full of water.  Get the pump all setup and ready to use.

Pour the gallon of water into the U and then tilt the tube towards the pump, so the pump starts trying to suck in that water.

I have more service calls on a disposal than any others. The tools you will need are a sevice wrench, flashlight and a pair of long pliers or hemostats. Shut off the power to the disposal first. Then stick the service wrench in the center of the disposal bottom (there should be a place for it on most). If it doesn't have a place to put the wrench, then the only way to unjam it is with a plunger handle stuck inside of the disposal (with the power off) and scraped along the bottom edge to free the cutting element. Either way, your should be able to use your flashlight and pliers to get whatever is out. If the disposal doesnt work after you clear it out, (doesn't turn) try pressing the reset button on the the bottom of the unit. As disposal is only good for what you scrape off of your plate. If you need to throw away larger quantities, it should be thrown in the trash. This will save you the inconvienince and expense of clooging your pipes or wrecking your disposal. Run lots of cold water as well when running the disposal. I've also had to remove coins, wires and even a few shot glasses from them, keep the cap on when you aren't using it.

Usually the cheapest and easiest way to boost horse power is to repace your air intake filter with a K&N air filter or some other "cold air intake system". In the old days we called it horse power in a box. The tuned headers are also a pretty good idea, but it's almost never easy to work on the exhaust. Or, maybe a chip for the computer.

My daughter put corn "silk" in the disposer, and it got really clogged up once! First you must turn off the electricity to the disposer, so you don't grind up your fingers or hand! The take the cover off the top and see what is in there and how full it is.  You can reach (it's yucky!) down in there and pull things out as much as possible. Try to get something (a large wooden spoon works great!) to put in and try to turn the blades (both ways) until you get them loose. Keep reaching in as you get it free to take out whatever is stopping the blades from turning. Keep working with the blades and taking stuff out (I have had to work at it for over 30 minutes for the worst one!) until you can turn the blades. Then reconnect the power and try to see if it will turn by itself.To prevent this from happening again, put a small amount of ice down the drain every once in a while or grind up lemon or thin orange peels to help clean the blades out (The lemons and oranges will make it smell better too!) Set a restriction of things that cannot go into the disposer, and post it next to the sink on a cabinet door. The next one who clogs it has to pay for the plummer, or do this diry job themselves!

First read your manual and find out how much and what kind of oil your car needs.  This is very important on newer cars whose tolerance is so small.Then go to the autoparts store and ask for a filter for your car and get the oil you need.  You should also have an oil filter wrench.  I reccomebd the ring kind not the kind tha fits over the top ore the visegrip kind.You might also want to get something conviniant to catch the oil in and tote it around.  You will need to take it back to a place that collects old oil.Then get on your back and find the drain plug.  Wait till you car is cool though.  Undo the plug and let the oil drain into the pan you got.  Next you need to find your oil filter.  You have a new one so you should be able to look for something the same shape.  it may be a different color though.Turn the old filter counter clock wise.  be ready though oil will come out a small amount anyway.Turn it over on your drain pan and let the rest run out of the filter.Put a small amount of oil on your finger and rub the gasket on the new filter.  Put it where the old one was and hand tighten only.  If it is easy to do without spilling oil you you should also prime the filter by pouring some oil into it.Replace the filter and the drain plug.  Fill you car oil fill (under the hood) to the recommended amount.  Replace the cap.  I have forgotten to do that a couple of times.  Boy did my wife get mad when her car was smoking.Mkae sure to take your oil and filter to a place which collects them.  Usually most chain autoparts stores will.M <SEP> how do you change car oil?

Excessive noise is the first clue. If it is an automatic, push down the park brake and move the selector from reverse to drive and back a couple of times. If if have a jerking and noisy transition, could be the rear axle. Nothing takes the place of a good inspection of the drive line. Support the rear axle on stands, shift the trans to neutral, apply the park brake. Try to turn the drive shaft as you notice the universal joints. No excess? Try to move the drive shaft up and down and side to side at the u-joint. No excess? Pull the rear cover on the differential and see what's going on in there. These differentials are a 7.5 in ring gear and will not take a lot of abuse. A reasonable upgrade for them is a posi carrier from a 4x4 Blazer or Jimmy. The carrier must be with the same axle ratio you have. I.E., a 2 carrier for a 2.73 or a 3 carrier for a 3.73. Unless you get the ring and pinion with the carrier. Next up would be an aftermarket carrier and ring and pinion gears. Next would be a stronger aftermarket differential, if you are really going to thrash it. Deep pockets for this one.

If you are starting to run into the wear bars, you should replace your tires.  The tread depth indicators usually denote around 2/32" of tread depth remaining, which is the minimum requirement in many states.  With the rainy season starting, that small amount of tread depth will be MUCH more subseptible to hydroplaning than a new tire.  Also, even if tires have a lot of tread, the rubber can break down and cause problems.  You can usually tell when a tire is being very loud on the highway and rebalancing won't fix the problem.  Please see the link below for expert advice from The Tire Rack on when to change tires. <SEP> how do i know when to replace tires on my car? if there are no abnormal bumps or bruises. there seem to be some tread depth markers in the grooves on the tire, but what exactly do those mean?
I and many others have found the plugins don't work but you can create your own blocklist using a browser's native functions.  In Chrome, open Settings and click on Manage Search Engines .  Scroll down to the bottom and add a new search engine. You'll have to add a duplicate Google (call it whatever you like) and make that your default search engine because Chrome won't allow you to modify the search string for its Google entry.  In the right most field the base search string would be something like this (I live in oz) where %s = your search terms:  https://google.com.au/#q=%s  To exclude trash sites from your search, add them after the %s in URL format,  excluding 'Junk Site' and 'Spam Factory' would be:  https://google.com.au/#q=%s+-%22Junk+Site%22+-%22Spam+Factory%22  If you use Chrome's Omnibox (the URL / search bar at the top) it will automatically append this to your searches, e.g., -"Junk Site" -"Spam Factory" .

No disrespect, but next time give more info: year your house was built, your landscape style that you mentioned but we have no idea what style it is.My house was built in 1906 and I chose a picket fence of my own unique design around the front yard; have 6' privacy fence of cedar around backyard ~ and nine different style gates that I have fun with, decorating and painting.Split-rail fences look especially good with ranch style houses and 1950-1960s houses.  Then again, I like them just about anywhere.  Picket fences date back to Victorian era, but widely used on just about any style house.  There's a saying:  If you want the fence to show, paint it white; If you want the garden to show, don't paint the fence.

You may not need to adjust the switch but the transmission linkage itself. Put the car in neutral with the wheels blocked so it won't roll, on the transmission you will see the switch with the selector shaft going through it and the cable attached to the lever. The nut where the cable attaches is the adjustment, loosen it and allow the linkage to relax. Put the trans shifter against the neutral stop and tighten the nut carefully so you don't move the transmission  lever. Now check the adjustment by moving the shift lever in the car to make sure you aren't off by one detent position, if you are go back and do it again. Now start the car with your foot on the brake and see if you got it. If you have it right you will now be able to take it out of park without the key. Next, with the car shut off and in neutral again you can set the neutral safety switch using a small drill bit, when the trans is in neutral the little hole should allow you to insert the drill bit. You just loosen the bolts and turn the switch to adjust it so the bit goes in easily with no force then snug the bolts down and check it out. <SEP> How do you adjust the neutral safety switch on a 1993 buick skylark?

Replacing the starter is rather easy. First make sure you disconnect the battery. If you don't sparks may fly. There is a large and small nut you must remove from the solenoid for the voltage and singal wire. Then there are two bolts that go through the starter you have to remove. Pull the starter towards the front of the car and pull it down(this make take some twisting and turning). Then it's just the opposite to install. If you can't get to the wire nuts try taking out the starter bolts first, just be careful not to damage the wires. <SEP> how do I change the starter on a 87 chevy camaro z28?

Take a bucket of water from the pool. Set it on the steps so it is surrounded by the pool water (to keep it the same temperature as the pool). Mark the water level inside the bucket. Mark the water level inside the pool. Give it 24 hours, then measure the water loss in both the bucket and pool. The bucket becomes your "evaporation constant". If the pool loses more water than the bucket, it's leaking. Do this test first. Then we'll discuss what to do if it is indeed leaking. That is a longer and more complicated procedure and it might not be necessary to go through it. <SEP> How can I test if my pool is leaking, or if it's losing water from evaporation?

Here is what I do.Apply weed and feed.Do not let the yard dry out or the grass goes into a dormant stage. (brown)This is probably the hardest thing to do.Resist the temptation to cut it short.Never cut it below 2 1/2 inches. 2 3/4 to 3" is best. A 3" cut leaves the lawn looking lush and thick. Instead of using fertilizer I use weed and feed, you can also buy weed and feed with grass seed in it.After you get the lawn looking pretty decent keep adding grass seed through-out the season.The last cut of the year I cut it 2 1/2" as I will get mold in the spring if it is left to long, but this might not apply to everyone. It depends on how much sunlight it gets. <SEP> how do you get a thick dark lawn? our yard is the worst looking yard in our part of the neighborhood.  all of the yards around ours are thick and dark green.  i would like to know how to make it look like that.

This is (currently) not possible using the web interface.  I'd recommend going through and deleting things you don't need in each folder, perhaps sorting them into folders such as "Keep", "Not Sure" then use selective sync with your PC to only sync the files you need. Though this is not very practical on the web interface as you cannot move around files by drag and drop. Downloading everything to your desktop is your best chance of sorting the files in your Dropbox.  Apart from traffic caps imposed by your ISP or limited local hard drive space I can't think of any reason why you would not download the whole thing and sort it there.  Of course you can always get one of your family or friends to accept an invite to join Dropbox from you to gain a 500mb bonus. <SEP> How to analyze size of files in Dropbox

Sounds like you have a loose neutral.  Sometimes under a load a poor connection will finally give way.  If I had to guess I would say the outlets were "back stabbed"; that is, the electrician used the connections on the back of the outlet.  If they are daisy chained, then when one connection goes bad it impacts every other outlet down the line.  The only way to verify it is to pull the outlets out and check the connection.  If you discover that is the problem, remake the connections on the screw terminal.  Turn the power off and don't do it if you feel unprepared for the job.  Doing it wrong could cause a fire or electrocution. <SEP> how to troubleshoot 2 wall outlets that suddenly quit working after turning on a lamp plugged in.? happened when turned on lamp plugged in to 1 of the outlets, no breakers tripped. when test outlet with a circuit tester get nothing when probes in both slots (where you plug things in) but it does light up when the probe is in 1 slot & other probe to ground.

You can't disable auto saving, but you can have it happen offline.  Make sure that you have offline Google Docs enabled and that your document is downloaded.  Then, disconnect the internet.  Start editing that document.  Now, you will be editing the offline version.  At this point, you can safely reconnect to the internet.  This will NOT force you to edit the online version of the document; you will still be editing the offline version until you click on the "reconnect to online docs" link (or whatever it's called).  Thus, you can edit offline even when online.  At the end of the day, when you are finished editing, you can reconnect and sync the chances with the online version.  This achieves offline editing without any of the mess of downloading, uploading, and having to deal with conversion and bad formatting. <SEP> How to disable auto-save in Google Docs?

Unless your refurbishing an antique collector's item, I can't imagine why you wouldn't replace the relay with a new one, even if an exact part replacement is not available.

We get wasp nests all the time under our eaves. Go to a hardware store and pickup wasp and hornet spray. The less expensive kind works just as well at the pricier version (I've done a side by side comparison).Wear goggles if the eaves are really high up so the spray doesn't get in your eyes, otherwise it's not necessary.Wait till early morning somewhere between 2:30 am -6:00 am when it's very dark outside to spray. Have a pole/broomstick handle and plastic handy. Aim a steady stream at the nest until no more wasps fall out of th nest usually 3 min depending on the size of the nest.

Go to your local auto parts store or dept. store's auto section and buy some foaming carpet shampoo. Spray it on and work it in with a clean cloth, turning freuently and chage cloths as needed.

My husband used to be a trash man, and he said that if you put cat litter or sawdust in the cans to dry them up you can then stick them in black trashbags and put them at the curb.  The reason they won't take them is that paint, paint thinner, and varnish has a tendency to set the back of the truck on fire (happens more than you'd think).  It's also a danger to the driver if the cans are punctured and they breathe it in.  If nothing else you've had them this long, check with your city or county and see if they are going to have a day when they take that kind of stuff from people, my town does it twice a year. <SEP> How do I dispose of paint?

the clutch idea is two discs with the same material as on your brake pads facing each other.  One is driven by engin.  The other is at the beginning of your gear box.When you depress the clutch pedal you seperate these discs.

Depending on the details...1.) Grab the head of the screw with a Vise Grips tool and use it to twist the screw out.2.) Use a saw or Dremel tool to cut a groove across the head of the screw and use a regular slotted screwdriver to take it out.3.) Invest in a screw remover tool, like an Easy Out- drill a small hole into the screw and drive a reverse threaded bit into it. As you keep tightening the reverse tool, it will turn the screw out.4.) Try a product like Screw Grab- a gritty material that makes screwdrivers or other tools fit the slot or hole in the head of the screw better.5.) If all else fails, just drill a hole about the size of the screw right into the screw and drill it away. You usually end up with a bigger, chewed hole this way, but you can fill the hole and try again. <SEP> How do I get a stripped screw out of the wall? brackets that hold guide rail going up stairs broke, but the screws holding the plate to the wall are stripped and stuck in.

I'm not sure if this is a feature that has been introduced in the year since the question was asked, but it appears that you can use a limited version without a Google+ account via Gmail chat according to this support article :   If you don’t have a Google+ account you can start or join a limited hangout, which only includes the option to hang out with 1 other person. If you’d like access to all Hangouts’ features including the ability to hang out with up to 9 people, share your screen, and use cool Hangouts’ apps, you can upgrade to a free Google+ account   This sounds similar to what Korey has encountered and what Freedom tried to suggest.

Do you know if the heater worked before you moved in??  Maybe it's been broke for a while.  If it did work and it looks to be in decent shape, then it's possible you aren't getting the match near the right place.  It's also possible that there may be another valve in the line, (actually there is supposed to be another valve), besides the saftety valve on the unit, that shuts off the gas to the thing completely.  That may be closed.   If it is, no amount of fooling around with the saftety valve is going to get it to light.   If you can find such a valve, it will usually have a red handle, or knob, that will be turned to a 90 degree angle, (crossways), to the pipe it's installed in.  If it is in that position, then it's off, turn it so it's in line with the pipe and then try to light the pilot.   If you've held down the pilot button for at least a minute and don't smell some gas down by the pilot area, then the gas is most likely turned off, or the saftety valve is no good. <SEP> How to light a gas heater? I just moved into an apartment with this old gas heater that is so difficult to start. There are no instructions besides "turn all valves to off position. Wait for 5 min. Apply lighted match to pilot at the bottom of firebox. If equipped with manual reset safety valve, turn knob to pilot position and depress button or turn knob hard left aginst the stop until pilot remains lighted when released".I turned the knob into pilot position, and while keeping it pressed, put the match to all sorts of places near the pilot- nothing happened. Actually I didn't see any holes through which the light from the match could start the ignition. Did anyone have experience with one of those? The model is "Holly Del Mar". There is this large rectangular heating section on the wall, the pilot box is at the bottom.
Your Air Conditioner drain might be partially clogged which causes water to remain stagnant in your heating and cooling coil box and mold to grow causing the smell.

Before any adjusting of the carb you must correct your timing by using a timing light. Crawl under the car with the car in park and the hot wire off the ignition, and have friend bump the ignition. With a flash light you should be able to see a groove on the harmonic balancer. Take a piece of soap stone or chalk and define this groove. With this done reconnect the hot wire to the distributor. Hook the timing light up to the battery and to the no. 1 plug wire. Now you are ready to check your timing. with the car running remove the vacuum advance line to the distributor and adjust the timing by turning the distributor to bring the timing mark to 8-14 degrees BTDC (Before Top Dead Center) this should get you in the ballpark for carb adjustment.There is not that much adjustments that can be made to a Q-Jet. The only one are the air and fuel mixture screws at the front of the carb. This takes allot of trial and error before you get good at this. If you turn the screws till you have your best idle you should be fine. That's what I do. don't forget to hook your vacuum advance line back up before making carb adjustments. <SEP> how do I adjust the fuel intake on my quadrajet carburetor?

My dad this by putting a drainage system in our back yard. That way you can dirrect the water somewhere besides your basement.Ill try to tell you how he did it. He rented a back hoe and dug trenches in our yard. Then put this special pipe in it and drilled small holes on the top so the water will go in. Then he covered it with crushed stone. Then he put dirt on top of that. Then just put down some grass seed, and your back in business.Any home improvement store shoudl be able to give you other ideas. But this is what i got on the top of my head. <SEP> How can I repair a leaky basement foundation? When it rains heavily, I get a couple puddles of water on my basement floor.

From what I understand, wood species commonly pressure-treated in the southeast US doesn't need injection holes.  That may be why Untouchable has never seen them.  The species used in the west (where I live) DO need injection holes (staggered parallel rows of half-inch long cuts).  Most PT stuff here is over-dyed brown, to get rid of the green tint from the chemicals.  And wood treated with CCA is no longer legal to sell in the US.  ACQ is a common substitute.  The new PT chemicals are more caustic than CCA, and require use of fasteners, straps and brackets with thicker layers of galvanizing.  Just replace everything--you'll take a big risk leaving the old stuff in place, and won't save much money.  The building codes in your area should be designed to prevent termite infestation, requiring metal shielding and no wood-to-earth connections, for example.  Follow them. <SEP> How do I know if something was built with pressure treated wood? I just bought a house with a deck. Now I find out there is termites in the wood.

Any advise is welcome.

These things are so annoying - the system also checks the spare tire, so make sure its inflated properly.Beyond that, the car's system is registering low and your hand gauge may not be accurate, so while you think your pressures are okay, the car disagrees.Add 1 lb pressure at a time to each wheel to see if that solves the problem, but do not go over the max psi printed on the tire.  If slightly overfilling doesn't get the light to go off, you'll have to take it in to the dealership to get looked at.Its okay to have your tires overinflated by 2-3 psi. <SEP> how do you get rid of the tire inflation warning on your dash? the rav 4 2006- it has a tire inflation warning signal on the dash.

The active ingredient in almost every Nail Polsih Remover is acetone, it has a very low vapor pressure and so it evaporates almost instantly from the surface to which it is applied.  A better solvent for this task is Methyl Ethyl Ketone (MEK), it has a higher vapor pressure than the Acetone so it works on the Cyanoacrylate (super glue) for a longer period of time.  If the countertop that you spilled the CA (Cyanoacrylate) on is a solid surface countertop like Corian you might have problems since it is another acrylic resin that could be dissolved by the MEK.  For the sake of Saving possibly thousands of $'s, please, please, please test the MEK on an inconspicuos area first.  If it dissolves the countertop material, follow the other suggestion and degrade the CA by placing a terry cloth rag over the top of the spill and pouring hot (not boiling) water over it.  Water slowly breaks down the CA and the increased heat will accelerate the process. <SEP> How do I remove super glue from kitchen counter? I have tried nail polish remover and it does not work.?

From what I read as long as you're projects are under $30,000 in value a contractors license is not required.

I'm no expert on Motor bikes, hopefully someone who is, will give you a better idea.However if you aren't getting fuel through, only a few  reasons, One, you are out of fuel, two, the fuel hose is crimped, and not allowing fuel to flow through, and three, the fuel pump isn't working.One way to check the fuel pump is to disconnect the fuel line, and try to kick start it, see if fuel is coming out.

The Car Power Steering System consists of the followings:1. Rack & Pinion Power Steering Gear2. Hydraulic Pump3. Oil Reservoir (you will find a small white plastic or metallic canister with a black cap on it & some traces of red color hydrulic oil, remember another Reservoir opposite to this Oil Reservoir with 'green' or 'blue' liquid traces is for radiator coolant)4. HosesThe Connection:There are three Pulleys:1. Main Crankshaft2. Hydraulic Pump (related to your question)3. Air ConditionerThe Belt connects these three items and in between them there is an IDLER pulley. This pulley is adjustable and is used for adjustment of the belt tension.So, the System works as follows, when you turn ON the ignition:1. The Hydraulic Pump starts pumping the oil to the Power Steering System (supplies pressurerized oil to one inlet, through one of the two main Hoses---called as 'Pressure Port').2. The 'Return Port' sends back  the 'used' oil back to the Oil Resevoir through the other remaining main hose---to make it available for the Hydraulic Pump to use when needed.So the cycle keeps on going until you switch OFF the engine.Changing the BELT (your question):1. Loosen the IDLER Pulley.2. Remove the Belt over the Crankshaft, Airconditioner and Hydraulic Pump pulleys.3. Replace new belt in the same way.4. Tighten the IDLER Pulley. When you tight it, ensure that the tension is about 2-3 mm (press & pull the belt until you get the 2-3 mm up & down belt movement feel---after you place it over all the three pulleys---at the same time tightening the IDLER pulley at the required torque (so that it doesn't gets loosen easily).Ready! <SEP> how can I change the power steering belt to a 1987 maxima?

Kiddo that is a hell of a good question! Not is is not only women that get the shaft! It is men also.The best way is to find an honest mechanic and stick with him as much as possible.The way to do that is by word of mouth. Talk to other people about him or her!  Then get several estimates if possible. Ask them what is wrong with it and get a full written estimate each time. Then compare them.I've been burned myself and I normally do 95% of my own work.Another way is to getting to know people at the parts dealers in the area like Auto Zone, Napa and O'Relly's they usually know who the good/ honest mechanics are in the area and who not to take your car to. <SEP> How does a woman find an HONEST auto mechanic?

If you damaged the threads on the spark plugs only than just get new spark plugs. If you damaged the threads in the cylinder heads than you may beable to use a tap and fix the threads but more likly you will need to get somthing I would use called a Helicoil. You can get them at your local auto parts store. If you are feeling lucky you can do it while the head is on the engine but for best results you should remove the head from the engine. There is a special tap that is made to cut the threads from the inside out so you can tap the holes without removing the head from the motor.

Do you have access to an electeric hacksaw and a welder.  If so use the hacksaw to cut like a door in the top, pry it up, then with a hammer and chisel(screwdriver) knock the insides to pieces and dump them out. Push the cut part back down and weld it back together-make sure to get it sealed so there is no exhaust leaking.    That way it will still pass the visual inspection if your area requires an emmissin inspection with your state inspection.

Could be a problem thermostat.  Could also be a gas flow issue, meaning one or more of the gas exhaust vents has become clogged (e.g., with burned food) thereby limiting the total gas into the oven, which would limit the maximum temperature the oven could reach.To answer your main question, your oven works just like your home heating--a thermocouple/thermostat determines the temperature it is, and depending on the temperature you want, it lets gas flow or not (usually full on or full off).  The gas burns due to the pilot light. <SEP> How does the temperature contol work on a gas oven?

Park the car and look at it from a distance directly in front and directly behind. If the front left corner is higher or lower than the front right corner, or if the back left corner is higher or lower than the back right corner, it may be time for a new suspension.Remember to take uneven loads out of the car first (no heavy boxes in the passenger seat), and remember that most roads slope slightly toward the curb, so a difference of an inch or two is probably ok.Other ways: If, when you drive over a bad road or railroad tracks or other rough terrain, the car should not "bottom out" (you'll feel it) on its suspension if the car is not excessively loaded.Also, a bad suspension may cause the tires to move out of alignment, and they might start developing unusual tread wear patterns (all wear on the inside half or outside half of the tire, for example), and you'll be able to see it. There are other things that can cause this so this does not automatically point to the suspension. <SEP> How can you tell if you need new shocks or struts?
is your car shaking, leaking oil, and the check engine lite  on? you have to adjust/ change the timing belt, do the water pump while youre at it because its all in the same area, and the chances are the pump will go bad, since you are the point of changing the timing belt.  and its a lot of work and time$$$  but from these symtoms, you may also have a spark plug thats not firing, or a vacuum leak in your intake manifold causing rough idle.  you will also fail an emmissions test in the leak case.  its a 11 year old economy car, you man want to look into something newer? foriegn? <SEP> how do you adjust or change the timing on a 95 plymoth neon?

Coffee Stains: To remove coffee stains from cups or counters, rub with baking soda paste. For stubborn stains, rub a drop of chlorine bleach into the affected area until the stain disappears, then wash immediately with hot soapy water to prevent fading, and rinse well. <SEP> how do i clean my stained kitchen counters? i'm moving out of my apartment soon and need to start cleaning up. the apartment's older (built in the 70's) and the countertops in the kitchen are original. i'm not sure what the actual type is, but i'm sure it's just the basic stuff that was used back then - not tiles, but just a flat continuous surface. not vinyl, but something fake like that.anyway, it stains VERY easily (coffee, juice, inks from papers that mightve gotten wet) and i'm just looking to see if there's any way to get these stains out before i move. any advice would be appreciated!
.if the scratch isn't too big it can be polished with toothpaste. Just apply a small amount to scratch and with a soft cloth rub in circles. If the scratch is too big it will need to be taken to a repair shop try a windshield repair shop.

These are extremely effective but also can be extremely expensive. <SEP> how to fix scratched mirror?

I really don't think you can bleed a clutch plate.  but you can bleed the clutch assembly.  Anyway if you have a hydraulic clutch system. Locate the reservoir and fill it with fluid normally Dot-3 brake FUD.  You must bleed the reservoir first, to bleed it you must open and close the hydraulic line at the cylinder. Then locate the bleed valve on the actuator (master cylinder) unit. You must bleed it also.  Have someone to pump the clutch paddle 15 times and hold it to the floor.  Open the valve quickly and let out the air, close the valve, have them to release the paddle and repeat until the air is gone.

Be sure to till up the ground at least 6 weeks before planting season starts in your region. Then pick out what you want to grow. Be sure to pick an area of your yard that gets enough sunlight, or has shade for certain veggies. Tomatoes love sunlight, but quit growing at 96 degrees. Also, do not water tomatoes from above, they must be watered at the root. Corn must be planted in rows of two as they need to cross fertilize. Also, pick a really good fertilizer. I've had good luck with Back to Earth <SEP> how to grow vegetables at home ?
Some appliances, notably microwave ovens and CRT-type TVs (normal TVs), have electrical storage parts called "capacitors" inside them and also very high (higher than 110VAC) voltages. The combination means that even unplugged these appliances harbor dangers within. Like applpro said, I'd be *very* hesitant to recommend that a DIYer open either of those appliances for the simple reason that you might give yourself a nasty shock.That said, if the microwave has a fuse, it is almost certainly either in an outside-accesible holder (on the backside), or very near the 110VAC service entrance, well away from the (hopefully shielded) high voltage supply for the microwave generator.  Carefully examine the backside for a fuse holder cover. If not found, take it to an appliance repair person.You should confirm that the power outlet used by the microwave is ok.But, I doubt it has a fuse. If the microwave is "dead", probably some part of the powersupply has died, or perhaps some part of the brain.  In either case, diagnosing the problem can be a real chore, repair would likely require replacing whole circuit boards rather than single components ($), the manufacturers don't generally sell the boards to DIYers (liability risk), and when it's all done you've invested more effort than you would buying a new microwave oven. <SEP> How can I fix a microwave that seems to have a fuse blown?

The dangers of making your own pressure washer could result in serious injury.  You would need to create a sealed compression chamber for your air that would have to create 1400+ PSI and hold 1-5 gallons of air for personal use, and 20-50 gallons of air for commercial use.  you would then need a water source, hose or tank.  by the time you go through all of this trouble you will have spent more than you would to buy one. <SEP> how do build my own pressure washer with gas motor?
Will depend upon if your leak is at the faucet or the plumbing underneath the sink. "Rebuild" kits for the faucet are available at those large box home improvement stores. You'll need the manufacturer's name and model. Usually they contain the necessary o-rings, washers, etc. to fix most dripping faucets. Worst case is a replacement. You will probably not need any specialized tools, perhaps a hex key of the right size. Just follow the directions. Try to keep a rag between chrome surfaces and your tools to avoid scratching. Make sure you turn off the water, hot and cold, before you start and put a rag in the drain to avoid loosing small parts.The under the sink plumbing can be a bit of a bear depending on the material used. Plastic is really easy. Disassemble the trap (there's about a cup of water in there!) and check for cracks and worn gaskets. Parts are redily available at that same store. Make sure you have the correct size. Again, worse case, replace everything. Large slip joint pliers or a small pipe wrench may be required.In both cases, look for worn, cracked or pieces that have slipped. Generally it is more cost effective to replace gaskets, small pipes, etc. rather than trying to salvage something. The repairs are pretty easy. Go slowly, keep things in order for re-assembly and things should go fine.I make it a practice to ALWAYS WEAR SAFETY GLASSES, even while doing a job like this. Good luck! <SEP> How to fix a leaky sink? It keeps dripping

I've worked in a wheel manufacturing plant for over 2 years. They get the balance checked at the machining level. Then they get polished and powder coated. If a wheel is "unbalancable" it is not sent any farther through the process. I do not believe that a simple powder coat will throw off the balance of a wheel so much that it wouldn't be balancable after the fact. As stated in another answer, the tires have to be removed for the pc process, so it seems logical that they will get re-balanced when the pc process is complete. In the bay area, you can plan on it being expensive to pc any type of wheels. Call around, search the web, investigate prices on this before just shelling out big bucks!!!! In short...Powder Coating wheels will NOT affect your balance beyond drivability. Hope this helps you. Good luck!!! <SEP> how does powder coating affect wheel balance?

The drain it's self unscrews out of the bottom of the tub, and a new one re threaded back into it's place. If it is the overflow, there are 2 screws that hold it into place, they can be removed allowing you to pull the water stop assembly up and out of the hole, you do the opposite to replace it with a new one. PS when you replace the drain in the bottom of the tub there are 2 things you will need. 1. the drain removal tool, and 2. some plumbers putty, both of which can be found at your local hardware store. Take an amount of plumbers putty in your hand and roll it into a log. Wrap it around the drain, and re-insert the drain back into place, if you have used enough plumbers putty it will work out from around the drain  (all around) as you tighten it back down.Good luck. <SEP> How can you repair a bathtub drain ??? w/o (tearing out the wall)that my husband wants to do, lol  , cause On the other side of the wall is our built-in dishwasher in the kitchen next to that is our kitchen sink  ??? we dont need to make an ant hill out of a mule hill !!! so, what's an inexspensive way should we go about repairing ???

The filter case is salvageable even if the top nut is stripped. There are a half dozen ways to do this and it all depends on the space you have to work with, how far down that nut is engaged and your skill with hand tools. I've had to do this twice with stubborn hayward cart filters and had to use a different approach both times. Your best bet is to get a tech in. There's just too many "ifs" here to suggest one method over another and ideally you want to start with what may work with the least damage, first. No telling what that is unless you post a picture of it or have someone actually look at it. If you have room and the nut isn't engaged fully, myself, I'd be cutting off the plastic surrounding the brass for both a better look and to see if it's worth a shot at cutting the brass threading off being careful not to ding up the rod threads. Like I said though, it's all a judgment call. If you do decide to tackle it, be careful.You can easily bugger up the lid and also potentially snap the rod out of the base.

If I'm reading your question right, there may be a pretty easy remedy. To correct the hitting near the top of the jamb, remove a hinge screw (closest to the interior of the house) and drive a 3 or 3 1/2 inch screw through the jamb and into the framing beyond. Usually tightening the screw will pull that hinge away from the opposite jamb and correct the scrubbing. However, when you pull the hinge there is a tendency to lift the other side of the door, so watch the margin between the top of the door and the top jamb so you don't create another scrubbing problem there.    The gap at the bottom is not as easy. To correct this you'll need to remove the casing from the hinge side of the door. If you cut the caulking where the casing meets the wall before you pry on it, you'll minimize the damage to the wall finish.  After the casing is off, place a pry bar, screwdriver, or whatever behind the  bottom hinge (between the jamb and framing) and push the hinge toward the other side of the jamb. Watch the gap and see if this helps. If so, drive a wedge behind the hinge and secure it with a small nail. Again, pay attention to the margin at the top of the door to make sure it's not binding. If everything looks OK, cut the excess off the wedge and reinstall the casing. Hope this helps <SEP> How can I straighten my front door?

sounds like the float level is too high and the noise you here is water going in the overflow and to the bowl.

Most often, "gold" house numbers are actually made of brass.  After some time exposed to weather, the clear coating on the brass will degrade, and the brass will blacken or turn green.  You can refinish the numbers by cleaning thoroughly with a good brass polish.  Buff the cleaned brass to a high shine, then apply several coats of spray polyurethane.  This refinishing job will last several years, or until the polyurethane is again compromised by the weather. <SEP> how can I refinish gold house numbers?

Driving a standard trasmission vehicle takes practice to become profficient. There are several things your mind and body need to learn  to do at the same time or close to the same time. Using first and reverse gears are the most difficult, and down shifting can take a while to get the hang of as well. First you need to get the car moving. This is where first gear is utilized. While slowly letting up on the clutch you will feel a small pressure point in the clutch. This point is where you know to push in the gas just a tad bit and the car (if done correctly) will move forward slowly. It takes getting a full mind and body "feel" of the car, of how the clutch and gas engage each other. While you practice you will jerk a lot and kill the engine. It is getting that combingation of the right clutch release point while giving a bit of gas which starts the car in a forward movement. Once you get the car moving you then shift to second gear. The only gears you need to engage both the gas and clutch at the same time are first and reverse. The other gears can be changed just by pressing in the clutch, changing the gear, letting up on the clutch completely and engaging the gas pedal. Finding the engagement between first, reverse and the proper amount of gas to apply can be difficult at first. Go to a large parking area or a long dirt road and practice. I taught all my kids (8) to drive a standard. We always started with the standard as I feel strongely that once a person masters a standard they will not have any problems with automatics, or trucks, etc. Downshifting is important and can be a bit difficult to master too. Driving a standard requires using much more of your mind and body than an automatic. You have to be aware of the RPMs so you can know when to shift, either up or down. Listening to the vehicle with your mind and feeling how it is responding with your body is required with a standard much more than an automatic. Automatics are easily driven, requires less mental and physical joining with the vehicle and is not as fun. There is more advantages to driving a standard than getting better gas milage or being able to push start it. When driving a standard you can have much more control of the car, and it is simply fun to drive when you are focusing so much of your mind and body with the car. Like I said, just find that point where it feels the clutch has a bit of resistance, slowly press a bit of gas and the car will either go forward, or jerk a lot and then die. As you practice finding that point with the clutch use your whole body to "feel' the car and what it is doing. That is the best advice I can offer anyone who is getting ready to learn to drive a standard. Now, some are just naturals and it comes to them easily, while others have to practive a lot. Do not allow yourself to get discouraged or think you can't do it. Anybody (unless mentally handicapped) can learn to drive a standard. Just remember that even after you have the car functioning and on the regular road you will still require time to get all the proper shifting down pat with further practice. Try downshifting prior to stopping and making the stop as smooth as possible. Also try making your "take off" as smooth as possible as well. By working to make these transistions smooth you will be taking good care of you vehicle. Those who get cocky and refuse to believe they need to learn more finesse in standard transmission minipulation after getting it onto the road are very hard on their vehicles which wears the clutch and other parts more quickly but also put otheers at risk by failing to fully master this type of driving. It is so fun to drive a standard with torc and horse power on a windy road!! It feels like you are one with the car, joined together and it is a blast!! Good luck in learning this type of driving. It is a real skill and if you are patient with yourself and allow yourself to fully master this you will have so muc <SEP> How do i drive a stick????

Do as the previous answer to get the brake caliper off, then remove the dust cap, cotter pin, hub nut.  When you pull it off the outer wheel bearing will come out.  The inner wheel bearing is trapped by the inner wheel bearing seal.  you'll destroy this seal getting it off but new ones are about a buck.  Clean all the grease put of the bearings, inspect them and re-pack them if you are reusing them.  The part the bearings ride on inside the hub is called the race and they are pressed in the hub.  Your new hub should have them in there already and you may want to buy new bearings just to be sure you're good.  I usually don't but you may want to.  Put the freshly packed inner bearing in the hub and tap on the new seal gently w/ a block of wood for a buffer.  Slide this into your spindle and place the outer bearing on.  Put the washer with the little nub orientated in the groove on the spindle and then put the hub nut on.  Tighten the nut and turn the wheel.  Keep tightening till you feel good resistance in the wheel turning effort.  Back off the nut a little and then repeat this step again.  when you have the wheel just to where it spins freely, hopefully your cotter key will line up with a hole.  Adjust slightly as neccessary.  Replace the dust cap, clen ALL grease from front and back of brake disc and reinstall the brakes. <SEP> how do u change a hub rotor? ford f150 xlt2 weeldrive

First, check and make sure the Breakers are on.Now, if its on, and not blowing cold air, check your furnace plenum, and see if it has frost on it. If it does, then your A/C is low on freon and you need to get it charged.Now, if you dont see frost, it could be your filters are plugged.  Take them out and replace thesm.Or, if you have an electronic air cleaner, wash the filters out.Now, if after all that, you still have no air, then your coil is probably plugged inside the furnace, and you need to go to the A/C place and get a can of cleaner. Then you spray the coil and it will clean the dirt and crud that is caked on.  (You must dissasemble the plenum enough to get to the coil, there should be screws holding it together so you can get to it).Try these and it should get that thing working... If your low on freon, then you have to call the service man to come and fill it, (you have a small leak some place and you may want to pay him extra to do the test to find it), also, if you have the plenum off, you can see the frost and ice on the coils, that tells you its low.Now, for a "quick fix" (if you REALLY need it for a while), put your furnace on!! Put the temperature up to the highest setting to get the flames to kick on. It will thaw the ice in a few minutes and then you can run your A/C until the unit ices up again...This is only a "temperary" measure and you will need to get the unit serviced...I wish you well...Jesse <SEP> how do you fix home airconditioning unit?

First, do not use a knife or razor. Either the paint is sticking the sash to the frame, or paint got in the window slider..sometimes when you paint windows it's not uncommon for the wood to swell also. Take a stiff glazing or putty knife and slowly work it into the edge where the sash meets the frame and work it slow, wiggle around the whole edge...in painting terms this is called "Breaking the window".... remember to pry slowly and evenly around all the edges, use your palms to press against the sash, don't bang it please...Now, when you do manage to get it open, leave them partially open as much as possible, make sure you check on them every so often as it can take two or three days for the paint to 'Cure'...I've restored many old homes, opened windows that were painted shut for years...Be patient... <SEP> how do i get my windows back open? i just hired some painters to paint them and now there glued shut. i dont want to pay $50 for them to send someone back out, so how can i do it myself

There are four common things that will cause your machine to not spin.1) A bad lid switch2) A bad motor coupling3) A bad timer4) A worn spin clutchWith a bad lid switch the machine just stops when it it supposed to spin and drain. With a bad motor coupling it will not spin or drain but you will hear the motor run. With a bad timer you may get the machine to spin and drain in another cycle or even have some action for a short time during the time it should be spinning. With a bad spin clutch the machine will attempt to spin and may even spin very slowly but will never get up to full speedIf you need further assistance you can contact me and I will be glad to help you.. <SEP> How do you fix a Kitchen Aid washing machine that won't spin?

Check for three things.  The first is if the 'rooter" is removing gunk from the pipe. Pull it back occasionaly and check the tip and see if it has reached the clog.  If its fairly clean run the rooter farther down the pipe.  You may feel the rooter bit or grab into a larger or harder clog in a pipe.  If you do make sure you keep advanceing the rooter past the clog untill you feel the rooter loose the resistance as it exits the clog.  You may have to pull it back and advance it several times though the clogged area to completly remove all of the build up.  The last and most imporant thing to check is how well the water flows though the drain when your done.  If it still is slow or not flowing well, try again.  You might not have gotten all of the clog or there may be more build up down the pipe.  I like to snake the drain as far as the rooter will allow, even if I find a clog a short way down the pipe.  That way I know I've cleaned the pipe as well as I could and hopefully don't have to drag the rooter out again for a long time!!  After you get the pipe clear, try using a bacterial pipe cleaner every week or so.  It is harmless to you and the pipes ut will keep them very clean.  You can find the product at any hardware store or even WalMart.  It works well even on partially clogged drains and usually opens them up in 3 - 5 days. And you don't have to deal with the mess and hard work of using the rooter!! Good Luck <SEP> how do i know if the roto rooter im using is working?
How old are the windows?  You may want to talk to the manufacturer before you do anything.  They may be able to offer the best suggestions for your windows.The problem has to do with relative humidity, the temperature inside your house and the temperature outside your house.Several conditions can increase condensation problems. If you close drapes over windows, this can cause the glass temperature and the temperature of the air between the drape and the glass to become cooler, making condensation more likely.  If the thermostat setting is dropped substantially at night, this will cause an increase in relative humidity and may increase condensation. This condensation should vanish once the temperature rises in the morning.  Cooking with uncovered pots, taking long showers, and poor ventilation overall all add to the humidity in your house.These sites offer some suggestions.

If you need to replace the existing roof mounted antenna aerial then all you need to do is unscrew the old aerial and screw in a new one.

Well do NOT USE DRAINO Or L-Plumber These products will eat the pipes. BAD IDEAUse a plunger alot with very hot water. If this does not work then remove the trap under the sink and clean it out. Make sure it is a 1 1/2 trap and not a 1 1/4 trap if it is a 1 1/4 put in a 1 1/2 trap.Also if the kids are causein this with TP then change brands and tell the kids not to use so much and also put the stopper back in the sink this will stop big chunks from going down the drain.I would say if the problem is beyond the trap and in the wall then snake it out and use (roto-rooter drain cleaner) Call your local dealer for this. The product does work good but if the kids are useing that much TP there is not much your gonna be able to do.The only thing you could do is talk to them and make sure the stopper is in and there is 1 other thing.You could remove the pop-up-assm and put in 1 that has no stopper but it has a screen (like what you would see in a tub a bunch of small holes.

The same spiral balances have been used in the window industry for many years.  They are notorious for the type of problems you describe.  Replacements are readily available and are fairly cheap.Remove one of the failed balances and take it to any glass repair shop.  Many of them will deep an assortment of the balances in stock.  If not, they can order you the same balance.  They will probably cost you about $15.00 apiece.  Check the other windows in your house.  It could be that you have a window with the same size spiral balance that you rarely open.  If so, you might want to swap the balances and save some money.

Currently you cannot add a subtitle/caption track to someone else's video.

Get a Hayne's Manual.  It's too detailed to try and post here, and besides, what good will it do you on the computer?  Grab a Chilton or Hayne's manual for your car and go that route.  I had never done my brakes before and Hayne's got me through my first try, from pedal to pad.  It has pictures, tells you what tools you'll need and is step by step.  If you get in a jam, they even have a brake manual that I found to be helpful just by having more pictures in it.Do yourself a favor though.  I'm nearly positive that thing has drums in the rear.  When you jack it up (and of course use jack stands) pull off both wheels, both drums, but only do one wheel at a time.  Take a picture of it as well.  It'll help you in that, A) you can go to the other side and see how things are supposed to look when they're done and B) you can see what it lokoed like when you originally started.  It'll help, trust me.It's going to be aggrivating, especially since it's your first time.  It's a doable job with the right toos and information, but be prepared to do it right and thoroughly.

A nasty stain or unsightly hole doesn't have to ruin the whole carpet. Patch it.       Steps:  1.   Cut out the entire damaged area with a utility knife. Try to do this with just one cut on each side and avoid cutting through the carpet pad.    2.   Use the cut-out piece as a pattern to cut a new piece. Be sure to match the direction of the pile.    3.   Spread carpet adhesive on the exposed carpet pad and on the back of the patch itself.    4.   Put some adhesive under the edges of the carpet surrounding the hole as well.    5.   Press the patch into the hole and rough up the pile with your fingertips.    6.   Let the glue dry for about six hours and then vacuum the patched area.        Tips:   If you accidentally cut the carpet pad, fasten it down with a piece of wide duct tape.     If you don't happen to have extra matching carpet, get a remnant at a carpet store. Take your damaged piece with you when you go to the store to help you find a good match.     Use a sharp blade in the utility knife for the best cut.  http://www.ehow.com/how_8256_patch-hole-carpet.html <SEP> How to replace a piece of carpet?

First unscrew the armrest, and anything else on the door panel that maybe screwed in. Becareful, if you unscrew the lower guide light, the whole light assembly will come out, just unplug it, you'll  be ok. Then Along the edges of the panel you'll find these plastic clips retaining the panel onto the door frame...you  will literallly have to pull ( preferably a scraper may work, they do make tools for this, they look like big forks)on the panel to "un clip" from the door... Don't worry if you break a clip or three, you can find them on the Help Product isle at Pep Boys. Now when you have unclipped the panel pull up to get the window guides off the door edge, pull away slowly. You will have the window switch you need to unplug so pull panel away slowly and look behind panel to see if there are any connections you need to unplug. Ok now the door should be eposed! Just peel back the plastic cover carefully (if careful enough it will be able to re-adhere to door) Sometimes some window motors are rivted in, you will have to drill them out! They do sell rivet gun kits to replace the rivets. Now once the rivets are removed the motor should come free, becareful there are lots of sharp edges.... I'm pretty sure you can handle it from here! Just becarful when you place the motor in that it is lined up well and the track is straight...ok good luck! <SEP> How to remove car door panel from '82 Buick Park Avenue?

Over 20 years experience.www.lowratesappliancerepair.comHOW TO CLEAN AND REPAIR A KITCHEN RANGE HOOD:A range hood that doesn't adequately remove smoke and smells from your kitchen is usually suffering from one of a few common problems: The grease filter or some part of the exhaust ductwork may be clogged, or the fan may be bad. Neither of these repairs should take you much time.Overall Things You'll Need:Plumber's Snake Ammonia Soap Replacement Fan Screwdriver, or nut driver and socket Old Toothbrush Heavy Rag Plastic Pan Unclogging the exhaust system:Instructions: STEP 1: Remove the grease filter by sliding it out of its clips.STEP 2: Submerge the filter in a plastic pan filled with hot, soapy water and 1/2 cup (4 fl oz/125 ml) ammonia. Let it soak for at least 15 minutes. If it's still dirty, soak it again, then rinse it thoroughly and set it aside to dry.STEP 3: Remove the exhaust fan. Unplug the fan, then use a screwdriver or a nut driver and socket to take out the screws that attach it to the hood.STEP 4: Clean the fan blades with an old toothbrush dipped into the ammonia-water mixture (see Warning).STEP 5: Clean the inside of the exhaust ductwork, using a plumber's snake with a heavy rag tied around the end. Push the snake through the ductwork. Soak the rag in the ammonia and water mixture, then run it through the ductwork. Rinse out the rag and repeat the operation until the duct appears to be clean.STEP 6: Clean the exhaust hood that's attached to the outside of your house. Use the old toothbrush and the ammonia-water mixture to loosen the grit and grime around the flapper plate. Make sure the plate moves freely when you're done. If it sticks closed, it can prevent the exhaust hood from working.STEP 7: Reinstall the grease filter. REPLACING THE FAN MOTOR:Instructions: STEP 1: Remove the grease filter by sliding it out of its clips.STEP 2: Turn on the fan and inspect the motor. It needs to be replaced if it hums rather than turns, turns very slowly, runs for a short time then stalls, or feels very hot and won't turn.STEP 3: Disconnect and remove the fan, following step 3, above.STEP 4: Take the fan to an appliance store to get an exact replacement.STEP 5: Install the new fan. OVERALL TIPS AND WARNINGS:Never put a grease filter in your dishwasher to clean it. You could end up with a film of hard-to-remove grease on the dishwasher walls. Clean your grease filter monthly. It's your first line of defense against grease and grime that can damage the fan motor and plug the ductwork. When cleaning the blades on the exhaust fan, take care not to wet the motor. The water could short-circuit the motor when you reinstall it. <SEP> How do you find/install a replacement over-stove kitchen exhaust fan? Are is making funny noises and dying.

The problem you have is that your water is too cold.To fix a sweating toilet tank.1. Turn off water supply at line at line to tank.2. Flush toilet to drain tank, use a cup to remove excess water and use a old rag to completely dry inside of tank.3. Find old pieces of styrofoam, usually you can find a couple of old coolers to use, cut in square and rectangluar pieces.4. Glue styrofoam to inside of tank. (snug pieces together)Use a waterproof adhesive, don't use too much or to little, usually has to dry atleast 24 hours.5. Make sure styrofoam does not interfere with any of the flushing mechnanisims, i.e. handle, float.6.

The answer is in ScottE's brief note.  Your house's problem is in the ducting and dampers.  I suspect a few breaks (disconnected branch ducts).Start at the heater and trace the duct runs, test each damper to make sure they are open, look for "blowholes" or disconnected ducts.  Connect the disconnected, cover the holes (sheet metal patch pieces, screws and seal edges with duct tape), open the dampers.If you do all that and still have trouble, call in a Heating & Ventilating contractor.  Tell him to give you a quote for duct cleaning.  (They have brushes on a wound cable something like a dry Roto-Rooter.)  What I suspect, at that point, is that something large has gotten inside a duct (someone dropped clothes down a floor register or an animal crawled in there).  The HV contractor will find it and you'll have cleaner air circulating in the house.The typical house should have the ducts cleaned every 5 years for the sake of Indoor Air Quality. <SEP> How do I fix my heating system if one room gets very hot and others remain really cold?

Smith sounds about right. I would check the air pressure in the tires as well, (do it yourself) that will make allot of difference if they are under pressure and they may not look it.

You don't say what year, but generally speaking you have to redo most things electric (with the maybe exception of lights).  This includes radio, any kind of computer or electronic ignition, motors (fan, starting, windshield wiper),...  It can be really rough on some items like windshield wiper motors since the motor would probably have to be isolated from the vehicle, then + and - wires run preserving the original direction of flow WITHOUT it grounding anywhere (if you could find - ground replacements it'd be easier for sure).  I had a friend start on a really old MG and he gave up. <SEP> how to convert from positive to negative ground on and f-1 ford?
I really like the one with smashing the glass... but if you were serious... drive it like you would want to drive it later but don't maintain a specific speed.  By varying the speed you avoid harmonics and wear that is "tuned".  It is best to have even wear across the frequencies. <SEP> How should one "break in" a new car?
First MAKE SURE you have turned it off by turning off the breaker that supplies it with power (assuming it is electric).  If you don't it will burn out the heating elements.  Then just hook a hose to the outlet faucet on the bottom, open the valve on the top to let air in, and start draining. <SEP> How do I safely drain a Ruudglas Pacemaker Hot Water Heater?

Mix some powdered sugar with Twenty Mule Team Borax, about fifty fifty.  The borax kills the roaches.  They ingest it while going agter the sugar.  Using a plastic squeeze bottle like you might find in restaurants, squirt the mixture along all of the baseboards in the house.  If you have a basement, put it on the sills and floor studs, and put all along the edges of the attic, if you have one.  Repeat as needed.  Roaches tend to infest neighboring houses and trees, so you will probably have to retreat the house regularly.  Another thing you can put down is diatomaceous earth, or silica.  This is very effective since they track it back to the nests and it helps kill other roaches too.  It's a very sharp almost microscopic partaicle that cuts throught their carapaces, causing them to lose bodily liquids and die, almost like bleading to death. <SEP> how can you get rid of Roaches without having to call an exterminator??

A squeaky noise may indicate a loose fanbelt or a fanbelt encountering too much resistance.In this case the sound will be like: Whinnninnninnninnnn!!!If you have a serpentine belt (a belt that winds around engine components like a snake), you don't necessarily have to replace it. It may be just loose. Snug it up. There will be an adjusting bolt somewhere most likely near the alternator. Buy a Haynes manual for your car at an Autozone ($12.00). It will show you exactly where the bolt is if you can't find it.If you have one belt that wraps around the crankshaft pulley, the air conditioner compressor, and the alternator(a more simpler setup to the serpentine), there will be an adjusting bolt right in front of the alternator. Snug it up if the belt is loose.Does it happen when you are steering? Turn the car on and steer the wheel lock to lock. If you hear a whining sound, you need power steering fluid. Un cap the reservoir and fill it. The Haynes manual will show you where it is.Does the problem only occur when the AC is on? Switch it on and off with the engine running. It it comes and goes, and the belt is not loose, your AC compressor needs oil. Buy a can of R134a AC gas with compressor lubricant and inject it into the input port. The port looks like a tire valve at the top of one of your AC lines. Again, your Haynes manual and the directions with the R134a can will tell you the details.Good Luck! This should only cost you around $20-25 including the manual cost. <SEP> How do you know when your fan belt needs changing? My car (2001 Saturn SL-2) just stalled and wouldn't start for a few minutes.  When it finally started up, the brakes were stiff and it would rumble before it finally get some gas and go.

I figured it was the cold weather, but I'm now in southern AZ and there's no cold weather going on here.

Well you have dirt in the line.This does happen alot dont worry.1st remove the sullpy line from the faucet and tuen the water on point the supply line in a bucket flush the line out if it does not shoot water then remove the line from the valve and trun it on then. if the siuuply is a flex line you could run a hanger through it to clean it.See you have no water but you dont know where the water is stopping or jammed up at so if there is water at the valve and through the supply line then the problem is in the faucet.Ill get back to that. If for some reason no or little water from the valve your gonna need to remove the valve and clean or replace, Now back to the faucet.if there is water going to the faucet but none at the faucet  you need to clean out the faucet. if it was lets say a single handle delta faucet you would need a alan wrench and remove the handle then unscrew the top and remove cartdridge and clean. But how you asked your question it seems like you tryed to fix your faucet and didnt get it done correct or found it to hard to do. if this is the case you will need to get a plumber out there to fix it.This is a very common problem in plumbing you shut the valve off to do work and when you turn it back on it wont turn on or off all the way or it kicks up dirt and clogs the line. this happens more so in old houses but it will happen also in new homes.

Grab a manual for this.  It'll be easier and the directions will be much more specific to your car.  Haynes and Chiltons both make good ones with plenty of pictures.First, jack up the car and rest it on jack stands.  DO NOT DO THIS WITHOUT JACK STANDS.  People will say it's fine, and a jack will hold, which many will, however, I had a seal in one give out on me once.  An extra couple of minutes for jack stands will save you from the scare of your life.  Pop off the wheels.  Yuo'll be looking at the rotor and the caliper now.  You'll need....Brake Cleaner (aerosol spray)Something to catch the overspray, like an oil panWrenches and a socket setMaybe a set of allen wrenchesSome brake greaseNew PadsEmory Cloth (sandpaper)A bungee cord or a metal coat hangerA C-ClampPop off the caliper by unbolting wjhat is normally two bolts holding it.  Take the old pads out.  Using the bungee cord, hang the caliper somewhere that will give the rubber brake lines some slack.  Take your emory cloth, and sand circles into the rotor.  Not to make marks, more just to remove old brake dust and glazing.  Spray down with the brake cleaner thoroughly.Take the new pads, and follow the instructions on the inside.  You will be greasing where it tells you to...the BACK of the pads where there will be a metal to metal connection.  DO NOT GET THIS GREASE ON THE ROTOR.Place grease on the contact points on the calipers as well.  Use Brake Grease, or high temperature grease.There should be a giant piston on the brake line side of the caliper.  With the c-clamp, depress this.  You may get some fluid spilling out of your brake resevoir, but it's ok.  As long as none of the lines are disconnected, you won;t have to bleed the system.Place the pads in the caliper, put it back on the rotor, tighten and torque the bolts to specification.Open beer. <SEP> how do you change disc brake pads on a 1994 lincoln towncar?

Before starting, ensure you are on level ground.  Ensure you are in a safe location and can easily and safely get underneath the car.  Be visible to anybody driving by.  For yoru first time, have a friend help you or let someone know what you are about to do.  Unscrew the top where you put your oil in.  Have an oil catcher available (you can buy from any auto parts store).  Put your oil catcher underneath where your oil plug is (under the car) (find the oil plug according to yoru auto manual).  Go under your car and unscrew the oil plug.  It's going to be messy.  Oil will begin pouring out the hole into your oil catcher.  Wait until all the oil is poured out.  (now is also a good time to change your oil filter - but that's another question).  Rethread the oil plug - do NOT overtighten.  According to your manufacturer's manual, put the proper oil back in (i.e., 10-40, 10-30, etc).  You pour it back in where you unscrewed the cap at the beginning.  Put in the amount of quarts your manual states.  Check your oil dipstick to ensure you've put in the proper amount (not too little, not too much).  Good luck!  You can do it and save yourself a lot of money. <SEP> how do you drain oil from your car yourself?
Make sure the stat you purchase is made for your type of system. Many are built for various applications and may need to be programmed for your particular use. First, turn off power to your furnace to insure you do not fry your transformer. Then write down the connections to your old stat before disconnecting them. If you have enough wire, clip off the old ends and restrip the wires so they don't break off when tightening the terminal screws. Connect wires to the same terminals as the old stat. Usually (if you have A/C) the stat terminals will be marked r,w,g,y, and rc or common. There may be additional terminals for a stat that may also be for heat pump applications which would require wiring for a reversing valve. Attach the back plate (subbase) to the wall with appropriate anchors and use a small level before tightening the mounting screws in their slotted holes then simply connect the wires and plug the stat to the backplate. Turn the power back on and you are set to program.There are many different digital stats available. If you know someone in the HVAC business, for about 100 dollars Lennox and Honeywell both make excellent models with simple user interface which you can program from your easy chair then plug to the subbase.Whatever time program settings you use, give 1/2 hour lead time for temp change and do not program night setback more than 8 degrees. It takes more energy to reheat or recool the average home 10 degrees than you would save in energy by setting back. I also reccomend leaving the fan in always on mode when you can. This stops air stratification (uneven temps from flooor to ceiling) and provides maximum filtration. The models I mentioned have a 30% fan on setting to save energy and give better air filtration.If you live in a cold climate a good addition to your system is a duct mounted humidifier. Not only does it alleviate dry air problems such as static, and sinus dryness, you can heat at a lower temperature and still feel comfortableInstalling a new stat is not as difficult as it may sound, I'm sure you can do it, good luck. <SEP> How to replace a thermostat? Is it difficult? I'd like to switch from an analog to a digital thermostat that is programmable.

First, make sure you either drain the tank or run it down as far as possible. If your truck has a carb engine, the first thing you will need to do is to disconnect the fuel lines from the sending unit in the tank. If your truck has fuel injection, you will need to relieve the pressure in the fuel system before removing the lines. If you should happen to forget to do this, don't panic. You will just have some spray when you disconnect the lines. Once you have removed the lines from the sending unit, next remove any wiring for the sending unit. You may find it easier to remove the wires, and the fuel lines for that matter, if you  lower the tank a little.  If your tank has a rubber hose type filler neck, make sure to remove it from the tank. You can lower the tank slightly be loosening the gas tank straps that hold the tank in the truck. When you are sure that you have disconnected everything, you can remove the straps from one side at a time. You may need an extra pair of hands, too! Slowly lower the tank down and out. Installation is just the reverse. <SEP> how do you replace the fuel tank on a 1987 gmc pickup truck?

If the problem is the bolt does not line up properly with the stike you can adjust the stike plate. This is sometimes caused by normal settling of the structure. There are several things you can check if this is an existing lock. First check and see if all your hinges are screwed in tight, if the hinge screws have loosened over a period of time this will cause the door to sag slightly and cause a misalignment. Second make sure the screws is the lockset are properly tightened. In the case of typical entry knobs and dead bolts it is best to tighten the latch bolts first and than the screws through the lockset.If every thing else seems up to snuff you can place a small amount of paint on the bolt while the bolt is retracted. Close the door and work the knob or the lockset a couple of times. This will leave a mark on the door jamb or strike plate where the lock bolt is hitting.

hold on tight - I've been a builder for years and been on many ladders - the key is pay attention to everything you touch.   be sure the base of the ladder is on solid ground or at least seated in such a way that it cannot shift or kick out. When standing in front of the ladder your feet at the base - your arms out in front of you should just reach the ladder for proper angle too much either directin can be unsafe for kick out or falling over backward.

Make two deposits; half the first trip and  the other half on the second trip.You could also place a dipper and a plastic bucket next to the throne. If your load was extra heavy, dip half out and put it in the bucket. Now flush. Deposit the bucket's contents into the bowl and flush again.Sort of like a NASA launch. To deal with a heavy load you must approach the problem in more than one stage.Another approach might be to purchase some teflon solution and apply it to the interior of the bowl just before release. Especially if your plop is particularly dry that day.I hesitate to recommend purchasing a pressure-assisted commode because a massive blockage in the downstream drainage pipe could result in a nasty blowback in the throneroom. If this should occur do NOT deal with it yourself. Call Merry Maids.

Do you have an antique mirror that has silvering beyond redemption or has lost some of its silvering? You can have it resilvered, which is pretty expensive, or you can resilver it yourself, if you can find a kit, which is also pretty expensive and quite dangerous, or you can do it the quick and easy way. If there is just some silvering missing you won't need to remove the rest of it. If there are a few stains along with missing silvering, they add to the character of the piece. But, if you need to remove the old silver you can scrape the old silver off with a razor scraper (be sure it's a safe scraper and not just a razor blade) or remove it chemically. Be sure to dispose of the residue properly, because it will contain mercury and other dangerous elements. Also be sure to wear a dust mask if you scrape the old silver off. Next, you will need an inexpensive piece of 1/8" mirror large enough to put against the back of the original mirror. If the mirror is square or rectanglular the job is done. If the original mirror is shaped, then lay the original mirror on top of the new mirror and trace around the original mirror. If the mark is larger than the original mirror, be sure to remove the original mirror and reduce the size of the marked area so it will fit inside the rabbet of the frame. Next, using a glass cutter remove the excess mirror. If you haven't cut glass before, ask for some scrap pieces where you buy the mirror to practice on. If you aren't too successful with your glass cutting, then have the glass shop cut the shape for you. They will charge a fee which will be considerably less than resilvering or replacing a shaped, beveled mirror.If you are just interested in the process:First the old backing paints must be removed with paint stripper.  Then you remove the old silver with a special silver stripper.  Next the glass is polished with a red rouge.  Then a flux solution is put on the mirror so the new silver will stick to the glass.  Finally you mix the silver chemicals and POUR the silver onto the glass.  The mirror is then dried.  Two backing paints are then put on the back of the mirror and let dry. <SEP> how do you resilver a mirror?

Start with the simple:Replace spark plugsChange OilReplace Oil FilterWhite smoke is often burning oil.If an oil change and spark plug change doesn't fix your problem try a thicker oil (try 20/50 instead of 10/40).If your car creates tons of white smoke you might want to think about:Check compression in the head with a compression gauge.If compression is too low (need to check specs on your engine) then:1) Have valves ground (you could do this yourself, but paying a pro makes sense).2) Replace the rings on the pistons.3) Have head ground.If this doesn't fix your problem, you need a major overhaul. <SEP> how do i overhaul a gasoline engine? my engine emits white smoke

The generator has an external voltage regulator that must be checked for proper wiring and operation before condeming the generator.  The wiring to the generator must be checked as well.  The brushes on the generator can be replaced while the generator is still on the vehicle.  This is usually all that goes wrong with a generator.  Replacing the generator is somewhat complicated when the engine is still in the vehicle. I'll give it a shot but its been quite a while since I've done one.   The generator turns a blower that cools the engine located the big semicircular housing on top of the engine.  There is an oil cooler that sticks up inside this housing that has to be removed to get the housing off.  It is secured with 4 bolts if memory serves.  Remove the two 10 mm bolts on either side of the blower housing. You have to remove the generator pulley nut to take apart the pulley to remove the belt. Remember which shims went where.  Shims are used to tighten the belt. Remove the generator clamp and remove the generator stand or bracket.  After that stuff is out of the way you should be able to lift the blower housing to access the oil cooler bolts.  You will also have to remove the carburetor.  (Just 2 bolts, some hoses and a cable clamp).  When and if you get the housing out there is a large 36mm nut holding the blower fan to the generator that will have to be removed to transfer the fan to the new generator.  This job is a lot easier if the engine is removed from the vehicle.  Reverse the instructions above to reassemble.  I always wanted to say that!!  Other techs will understand. <SEP> how to install a generator on a 69 vw beetle baha? the battary keeps going dead and the red light in the speedometer is always on.

You start at the beginning. A cracked head or head gasket can have various symptoms. While the engine is cool check the radiator water to see if any oil is present. If no then check your oil to see if any water is present (it will look milky). If no then start the engine with the radiator cap off. Look in the radiator to see if it blows bubbles. If no then check the exhaust to see if much water or oil is coming out or is present in the pipe (Some water is there naturally from condensation. If it doesn't smell like anti-freeze you're OK)If no then visually inspect around the head and valve cover to see if any anti-freeze is present.If the answer is no to all of the questions the head and gasket are more then likely intact. The only other test I would recommend would be a compression test, but if you have never done one you may want someone to show you how or go to a mechanic. If you answered yes to any of the questions you probably do have problems in that area, though some could be caused by  mechanical problems other then a blown head gasket or a cracked head. <SEP> How can you tell if your car has a cracked head gasket?

First off, if you drop the thermostat into boiling water that is at least 190 degrees, you should see the center disc move away from the outer disc.On a more realistic note, I doubt you have a bad thermostat.  What was your reason for replacement in the first place?  If the car wasn't overheating originally, more than likely you have an air pocket in the cooling system.  Many cars come with a bleeder somewhere in the cooling system that allows air to escape.  If you do not bleed the air out, you have a cavity with no coolant.  This expands at a different rate than the coolant and can cause some serious issues with the vehicle.  Please respond with more information about why you replaced the thermostat and what kind of car you have. <SEP> How do I check a car thermostat with boiling water? My car is overheating.  I put in a new thermostat, test drove it - it overheated and the coolant backed up big time into the overflow tank.

Moss in yards has been a common complaint this spring. It occurs in sun or shade, alkaline or acidic soils and in wet or dry sites. Moss is very adaptable and can grow in difficult conditions. In poor sites, the moss moves in as the grass dies out.The easiest way to eliminate moss is to rake it out of the affected areas and alter the conditions responsible for its presence. If moss is occurring in a shaded area, consider planting the area with shade tolerant grasses such as creeping red fescue, chewings fescue or hard fescue. If the fine-leafed fescues have failed, perhaps it is time to consider alternative shade tolerant groundcovers rather than grass. Surrounding trees may need to have their lower limbs removed or the crown of the tree thinned to allow more light penetration. Remove unnecessary shrubby undergrowth as well.When moss occurs in a sunny location, consider fertilization practices. Even low-maintenance lawns need one or two fertilizer applications a year to grow well. In some cases the soil may be compacted and need aeration as well. Soil testing will provide the soil pH. Grass grows optimally at a pH of 6.8 to 7.2 which is close to neutral. Many people automatically assume the soil is acidic when moss occurs and want to add lime. Iowa generally has alkaline soils and liming can make matters worse. A soil test will eliminate the guesswork.Materials, such as copper sulfate, do eliminate moss in lawns. Use these products according to the label directions. However, copper sulfate only cures the symptom, the moss. They do not change the conditions responsible for its presence. When moss occurs in the flower bed or vegetable garden, simply rake off the moss and till the area. Once normal (sunny and drier) weather makes another appearance, moss growth should slow and disappear. <SEP> how to  get rid  moss in lawns?

From today (2016-05-20) on, Google is starting to roll out the ability to embed a chart from a Google spreadsheet into a Google document. At this point, two of my 3 Google accounts make the option available in the Insert menu, with a new Insert→Chart submenu below the Insert→Drawing… item.  When you insert such charts, they remain linked to the original spreadsheet. If all you want is tabular data, there's a table chart type that you can use to present your data as a simple table.  There are some limitations at this stage (e.g. regarding the size of the chart) and the chart must pre-exist in the spreadsheet before you can insert it, but this is going in the right direction…  The chart is not updated live if you modify the source spreadsheet while your document is opened, however, the document will detect changes and offer you to update your chart to reflect the latest changes in the source. <SEP> Embed Google Spreadsheet in Google Document

Not real sure. But, most fuel pumps are electric and mounted inside the Fuel Tank. You can trance your fuel line to be sure. Jack up the rear of the car and put on Jack Stands so you can look.

the regulator is attached to the alternator.  to replace just that you need to first find a regulator, which most parts stores will not have.  it is more cost effective to replace the entire unit.At worst a regulator would have to be ordered, but you never know what a parts store might have, however, it is an isuzu, parts aren't readily available.on the alternator there will be at least 2 wires/plugs.  one is a threaded bolt, that is the alternator output.  the other is usually a plastic connector with 2-5 wires, that's where the regulator plugs in.  sometimes the entire alternator has to be dismantled to get to it, others just unscrew off the backside. <SEP> how to change the voltage regulator on a 87 isuzu trooper II?  where is it locate on the isuzu ?

Black smoke is carbon smoke, blue smoke is oil smoke.

If you're talking about a transit the things are a nightmare to set up then you have to learn how to read them.To set it up properly you have to align the tripod over the point that you're shooting from using the plumb bob and make sure it's level, then put the transit on it and level the transit out.  This alone can take a while.Then you have to know how to read what it's saying.  Digital Theadolites (sp) automatically tell you the angle you turned once you line it up and set it to zero.  So you'll have to set it to zero then turn the angle and line it up.  Once you're close you can use the fine adjustment screws to line it up on the mark.  You'll need to turn the angle a few times and average out the readings.The type I used had a marking system that i can't remember the name of but it's very difficult to explain. <SEP> how do you use a builders transit?

The Rodeo is a twin to the Honda V6, you should arm yourself with this knowledge and start calling junk yards, salvage yards, auto wreckers, etc. This is the cheapest method.
