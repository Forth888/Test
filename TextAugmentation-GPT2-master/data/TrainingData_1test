Open the hatch, and look behind where the brake is. If you have to move the carpet out of the way do so. There might be some kinda plastic devie there to hold it in place, simply remove it by twisting if off like a nut. Then should be able to access the light from there. If not there should some screws that hold the light in place on the outside of the body. Remove the screws and the light will fall out of place; change the lights and install the screws again your done!! <SEP> How do I replace the upper brake light in the hatch on a volvo v70?
On older cars, there is a non rubber hose about 2.5" diameter that runs from the exhaust manifold up to the air filter housing snorkel. Inside the snorkel, there is a thermostat valve that directs warm air off the manifold to the intake until the engine is warmed up.

Get a hammer and a pointed chisel (one for metal or concrete, not wood) and just enlarge the hole.  Depending on if you have 2 hole or 3 hole blocks this will be either easy or hard.  (2 hole blocks have larger holes in the blocks than 3 holers)If it is a 3 hole block you may have to chip out a very large area, install the pipe and then use some cement to fill the voids around the pipe after it is installed.  A library, bookstore or home improvement center may have a book on concrete that you could look through that would be helpful too. <SEP> How to enlarge hole in basement block wall from 3" to 3.5"? The gas man red-tagged my hot water tank for several reasons.  I'm replacing the tank but also need to change the vent from single wall to double wall (Type B Gas Vent).  It goes through the block wall in basement and is very tight fit.  Single wall is approx. 3" diameter and double wall is about 3.5".  It needs to be double wall where it goes through the wall.  How can I enlarge the 3" diameter hole to 3.5"?  Can't possibly afford to hire someone. Can do water/gas hookups safely myself.  Vent from exterior of block wall on up is double wall.  Man said single wall vent wouldn't possibly get hot enough to ignite concrete(!) or have condensation problem if hole is TIGHT (it is, that's the problem) but his hands are tied b/c code states double wall vent _through_ the wall even if the wall isn't flammable.  I'm at the "panic stage" since they won't approve the new tank I'm going to install w/o the vent fixed.  Thanks in advance for help soonest!
"The air conditioning system in your car is comprised of a compressor, condenser, expansion valve and evaporator. If you have ever used a can of compressed air to clean computer components, you will know that the bottle gets very cold in a short amount of time. This is due to the rapid expansion of the compressed gas. The same thing happens in your car’s air conditioning system. Refrigerant (AKA Freon) is compressed in the compressor and turns into a hot gas. In the condenser, this hot gas is cooled to a liquid state and travels to the expansion valve. As the Freon goes through the expansion valve it returns to a low-pressure gas and rapidly cools in the evaporator. A fan blows over the evaporator and cools the air that eventually blows out your vents." <SEP> How does a car AC compressor work?If any one know some webs and pictures about it please send me.?

The Chevy Nova 1986 is basically a 1986 Toyota Corolla and it has a toyota engine in it.I recommend getting an Haynes Manual if you want to do this yourself. It is not an easy task. and unless you are really mechanically inclined I WOULDN'T recommend you do it yourself unless you've got a good manual and a friend who has done a timing belt. Typical steps to replacing a timing belt.1. Disconnect battery.2. Remove all accessory belts. (various means).3. Remove the harmonic balance. (On the crank shaft that was driving all the accessory belts. Usually the hardest part for me of a timing belt change.4. You may have to open the flywheel/flex plate inspection area or remove the starter motor and jam a screw driver into the flex plate to prevent the crank shaft from turning as you try to remove this bolt.5. Remove the timing belt covers. Typically an upper and lower cover.6. If necessary you may have to remove an engine mount as I recall the engine is a transverse mounted engine. If this is the case you'll have to support that part of the engine with a floor jack and preferably a piece of wood or something that won't punch through your oil pan. Or you can use an engine hoist from the top.7. Now align the crank shaft and cam shaft(s) to Top Dead Center (TDC) for cylinder 1. Usually there's marks on both the cam and crank shaft to indicate when you are at TDC.I believe the cam shaft has an arrow on it that must align with an arrow on the housing to indicate TDC.8. Now look for a pulley that is applying pressure to the timing belt, but can be loosened and be pushed against to loosen the timing belt.9. Remove timing belt.10. Install new timing belt.11. Release the tensioning pully so that it is applying tension.12. Tighten the tensioning pully in place.13. VERY IMPORTANT. CHECK to be sure you didn't mess up the synchronization between the cam shaft and crank shaft. So after re-applying the tensioner's pressure. You must try to turn the crank shaft two rotations and check cam shaft location. They should be the same as before. If not, your crank and cam shaft have gotten out of synchronization and you must take the timing belt off and re-sync them.If everything is in sync, then re-install everything in the reverse order.That's the short version of how to do a timing belt. Typically you can get through the entire job with a good ratchet set, a few screwdrivers and a nice set of wrenches. No other speciality tools are typically necessary unless of course you strip a bolt.Good luck. <SEP> how do I replace the timing belt on a 1986 chevy nova?

start with the ceiling, tack up with nails at least 8 per sheet then screws 8-12in on center in the field and six in. on center around the edges. make sure that they are hitting the studs or trusses. a 2x4 1-2in short of the ceiling with a 2ft piece nailed to the top like a T will help hold it up. make sure the nails and screws are just a little below the surface of the sheet rock.  to cut it either use a sheet rock square or snap a chauk line and cut through the paper and a little in the rock then bend it toward the uncut side it may need a little pop from your knee to snap it, then cut the paper on the uncut side with your knive. the easyiest way and quickest way is to hire someone with experiance. <SEP> how to hang sheetrock?

You'll need to obtain your faucets model#.  Most home stores(Home Depot, Lowe's, Menard's, etc.) will carry replacement valve parts for your faucet.  The best bet is to return the the place of purchase for the parts.  First start by turning the water supply off to your faucet.  Then remove the handle or handles.  If it's one handle there's usually a set screw on the back of the handle.  This will gain you access to the nuts that hold the valves in place.  Remove the valves and inspect, they may just need washers or o-rings.  If so it's an easy fix, if not just replace the whole valve cartridge if available.  If you can't find parts for your faucet then you may have to call a proffessional, he can order the parts you need.  Check out the link below, it has plenty of pictures and instructions.  Hope this helps.  Good luck. <SEP> how to fix moen mitchen faucet?
I managed to keep our old Dyson going after its main lead "sparked" by cutting the lead off about 5cm along from the damaged area.  I then used a special hexagonal driver to take out the panel alongside where the mains lead disappeared into the Dyson.  Inside was a simple plastic junction box.  I carefully disconnected the mains wires (remember I only had a 5cm bit hanging) and then connected the shorted mains lead in its place, carefully ensuring the lead was correctly routed around the cable retaining plug as per the old bit of the lead.  I then tested the lead and then replaced the cover.I am a trained electrical technician and the job took me 30 minutes.

Do you mean a veiwing sight?  If so, most security doors are just made of sheet metal with a hollow core.  Just mark the location of the hole  (check veiwer package for proper size), use a center or prick punch to dimple the spot, start the hole with a small (1/8") drill, then  select a metal cutting twist drill bit in the proper size, make very sure the  bit is stright level while finishing the hole.  From there it's just a matter of assembeling the veiwer following the instuctions that came with it.  The reason to use the 1/8" bit to start is two fold.  First  it is the best insurance to prevent the larger drill from moving offcenter and marring your door and also if you find that there are any supports or fireproof matrial unnder the sheet metal, it's much cheaper to break a small $1 drill bit than a larger one.  Any fireproofing material can be drilled with a carbide tipped masonary bit. <SEP> how do I install a door check on a securty door ????

What to do about ants without using poison?We Should not Poison Ourselves, Kids and PetsIt's a good idea to let ants know that yours is not their house, without killing them. For ants are very helpful to keep this earth clean. Using poison, we only poison ourselves, too, even when we do not realize it. Yet, a toxic effect can be seen immediately on life energy photographs after the use of poisons.Different PreferencesIn my experience, it depends on the type of ants what they like least.What can be Used?I have used cinnamon, peppermint, cayenne or citrus oils. Ants have a very sensitive sense of smell, and these items are too strong for them so that they avoid these. For some reason, some ants do not like cucumber rinds, grated and sprinkled around.Someone CheckingWith natural means we may not hinder all ants to come in, but most. They may be always a few ants just checking out our facility. If there is nothing they need, they do not call their armies to carry off the booty.Ants as Our EducatorsHelping us clean, the ants assist us to be very clean if we do not want their help. At least, they themselves do not poison us.Discourage Them Inside, but Give the Ants What They NeedWhat worked best for me is to distribute some of the above mentioned items around and in the house, and give the ants what they need outside the house.Knowing the WeatherBefore the rain they need oils and may find them when stove or floor are not cleaned. The ants know when the rain storm is coming before the weather man may know it. I have watched this for many years. They suddenly come in, in greater numbers, looking for oil, even on the pillow sheets, if they do not find it outside the house! The oil is needed to make their chambers waterproof! Especially in dry years they do not find enough sap of trees to meet their needs, and they enter the grease spotted house to meet their needs.Give Them What They Need - OutsideWhen the ants come in, in greater numbers, I know that a rain storm will come, although the sun is shining and no real cloud is in the sky. Then I place sheets of paper towel, soaked in olive oil, outside by the house, but a few yards away. This way the ants can smell the oil on their way to the house but are not attracted to the house directly. I hold the oiled pieces of paper towel down with some rocks. This way the ants can easily get the oil and walk off happily, leaving the house alone. One or two may still come in, but that's no problem. They are just checking.Ants like Seeds and StarchSprinkling sunflower seeds around also helps to keep the ants busy. A bag of bird seeds may be $4 and lasts a long time. It takes the ants some effort to carry off one seed, although the birds may gladly help to eat the seeds.The Queen KnowsOften, I wondered how the ants know what's in the house, where the sources are and when. Science found out that they have a psychic queen, who intuitively knows where the needed resources can be found. Amazing. Even when the ant queen was away from the ant home, she could still send her telepathic messages to the ants.Ants - the Garbage CrewImagine we had no ants on earth, ants who chew up the empty beetle shells. We would be swamped with these beetle shells, for they do not decay easily. The ants, like other animals in their own ways, take care of many other things for us, so that the earth stays clean.Let Them LiveFor that reason alone I think we need to be kind to the ants and tell them in a gentle way that we don't want them in the house, but let them live outside!A Stone Setting for the AntsI never had a major problem with ants as long as I gave them outside what they needed.

Depends upon the amount of overspray and what type of paint it was in the first place.  Can you flake off the specks w/your fingernail?  If YES, then just take out an old credit card and start lightly scraping it off.  This works for caked on road tar on the rockerpanels behind your tires as well.  I'm not too sure I'd do the paint thinner or any other solvent unless its a last resort (repainting your car is expensive and loses you resale value).

First check the pad to make sure that there are no visilbe leaks.If no visible leaks then fill the pool up to the maximum level. Then do what's called a static water check. Turn all the equipment off and wait a few days until the water seeks the level of the leak, in which case it will stop lowering. Then take a very close look around the perimeter of the pool water and look for the leak. If it is in the liner, then patch it. If it stops at a suction or return line take a close look for any crack or break, if so then use something like an A and B expoxy to repair it. You can get it at your friendly neighborhood pool store. If you think the leak could be in the pool plumbing (between the pool and the equipment) you need to purchase some expandable test plugs (you can get them at Home Depot and other fine hardware stores) and plug all the suction and return lines (including the main drain if you have one). Big bummer if you have to swim to the bottom in cold water. You may have to use a screwdriver to remove a plastic cover to expose the piping to get to certain areas. Make sure you measure the pipe before going to the store to purchase the plugs. Most piping is 1 12" pvc or 2" pvc. Once the plugs are installed, fill the pool again and wait a couple days. If the level stays the same, the leak is not in the pool liner, it is somewhere in the plumbing.  If the piping is underground then big bummer dude. If that's the case I would next talk to your freindly neighborhood pool repair person for the next step, which could be pressure testing, etc. It all depends on how easy or difficult it is to access your plumbing. Good luck. <SEP> how do you locate a hole in an above ground pool liner?

Here are some ideas to try:Sap usually drips from freshly pruned trees in the spring. Avoid parking beneath them if you have a choice!While engaging a professional detailer or body shop is preferable, there are a few things you can do yourself.- Try a mild solvent, such as Kerosene. This is the primary ingredient in most commercially available bug and tar removers. - Dab some onto a clean cotton or terry rag, and rub the paint gently. Do not rub hard or you run the risk of scratching the paint.- Our professional uses a citrus degreaser and a piece of soft modeling clay. He applies a small amount of degreaser onto the sap, and rubs gently in circles using the modeling clay until the sap spot is gone. - Once the sap is removed from the finish it is important to wash the vehicle and re-wax to restore the glossy shine. If there are any fine scratches, try removing them using a rubbing compound before you wax. <SEP> How do you remove stubborn tree sap from my car?

Locate the fuel line to the intake or fuel rail to the injectors. Disconnect the hose, and put a container below it to catch any fuel. Have a buddy or family member turn the key, but not enough to start the engine to rotate. If fuel is not flowing it could be the pump or fuel pump relay or fuel pump fuse. If fuel is flowing, it could be the ignition system. Like plugs, wires, distributor. Just do a process of elimination and try to save yourself some money. If you check the fusees or relays and they are good. The pump is more than likely in the fuel tank and will need to be dropped to replace. Just remember, use a quality part and do it right and do it once. Don't settle for the cheapest. The cheapest will leave you stranded on the side of the road in the rain or worse. Far from home with no money.  IF you are unsure about anything. Purchase a manual from your nearest auto parts store and read it! GOOD LUCK! <SEP> How can I tell if my fuel pump is working and if that is the cause of my car not starting? It's a 1992 Camry
You sure you want sway bars? There are better forms of suspension...coil springs don`t have the same "give"...I like them better..the ride seems smoother.

Remove all screws, knobs, switches and/or handles. Carefully pry the edge of the panel away from the door. It's held on by plastic clips that connect to the panel and fit through holes in the door metal. There are special tools for doing this but a needle nose pliers will work.

Goo Gone is a fantastic product (available at Target and most any hardware store or drug store) and works amazingly well on even pesky sticker residue.  Soak the area, and wipe it away.  It might take repeated applications, but you can remove the sticker without scratching, and without leaving a gooey residue.Note that Goo Gone can affect some surfaces, including some plastics, so you should be careful, especially if it is clear plastic.  I've used Goo Gone many times on plastic glassic and CD cases, so it will certainly work on many plastics, but you should be careful. In the event that Goo Gone seems too risky, you can frequently remove just the adhesive residue using plain old Scotch tape.  Remove as much of the sticker as possible (the paper/plastic backing) and then apply tape to the sticker residue firmly.  Pull the tape off sharply, and some of the residue will come with it.  This is a slow process so only do it if the area is relatively small, however, I frequently use this tactic for price tags and the like and it is surprisingly effective. <SEP> How do I get a sticker off of a car window  (plastic part)?

See if you can lead the water that comes down the gutters and downspouts away from the foundation.

Visit your dealership parts department.  They will look up the spoiler and let you know which parts you need, how much they cost and whether or not you can install it yourself.

Subsurface leak detection equipment.  U can't go by where the water shows up.  It seeks the past of least resistance & can show up 50' from the leak.  When I locate leaks I use an air compressor hooked to the boiler drain to the washer or the outside hosebib.  The air is easier to hear than water.  Sometimes if you put your ear to tha slab you can hear the air gurgling coming out of the pipe. You can also drill a 3/8" hole where you hear it best and when your over it the air will blow out of the hole pretty hard. I have equipment that makes this easy though.

OOH, that one involves some work.The most effective is to rent an excavator, possibly a mini depending on your yard size.Then you did out the ground in front of the house where it is taking in water. Enough room has to be there in order to refinish the wall to become waterproof. This could be masonry work, cement, you'll be able to tell once you get to that point.After that is done, back fill the dirt, and head to the basement. I used masonry caulking on the floors around my leaks.Another way is to hire the people who waterproof your basement for you. it will save you time and aggravation, I promise. They know what to do and what to look for. maybe they can come out and offer you some advice.Good Luck.I bought a product called DAMP RID at Home Depot to hang up in the areas of moisture.It's about $4.00 for a month's worth of help. <SEP> How do I get my basement to stop flooding?
"The normal way is to use a poultice (I´m sorry, a what?), which is a little tub of powder that contains clay and some sort of secret sauce." (It´s made by Aqua Mix and it´s for marble and other similar surfaces, available nationwide). Apparently the clay functions as a light abrasive and you mix it with water into a paste, smear it so it´s about 1/4-inch thick across the stain, put a piece of plastic wrap over this concoction, and let it sit 24 to 48 hours; it will draw the stain out.

I have the same phone, and last february I walked into a Battery Plus store (to help my friend find a phone) and the guy working there said that my phone (the z520a) is notorious for having battery problems. So far it's worked fine for me, but maybe in your case the battery did fail. Maybe you can try calling a local Sony store, or Battery Plus, if you have those in your area (I'm near Toronto). <SEP> How can my SonyErricson z520a be fixed? My cell phone apparently ran out of battery juice about 5 weeks ago and tried to recharge it, and when I plugged it ti the charger nothing happened.

Then I called Cingular to see what's going on, they were not able to help, and then I went to a local Cingular store and they said none of the C stores have technicians to repair phones. So now I have cell that is partially apart (because I unscrewed all the screwes that keep together and tried to put only 2 screws back (half way). Can anybody help me with ideas, suggestions, proven methods of fixing, or at least direct me to some local places(about 10-15 miles around 98043-which is just 10 miles north from Seattle), busineses that can fix it for sure and not costing a lot of money?Thanks, Paul.
Most of the time a capret extractor is used to clean upholstery, but you should NOT do this! If you get it too wet, the glue that attaches your upholstery to the roof will loosen, and then you'll have a real mess. Using a spray bottle with warm water, very lightly mist a small area, and then apply a capret cleaner. Gently blot the area with a damp rag. Then blot or air dry. For stubborn stains, you can use a sponge or a brush, but don't scrub the area too hard. As far as the nicotine smell, you can purchase automotive-sized air purifiers that really do a nice job on nicotine.

The best boxes to move with are 24-ct longneck beer boxes. In San Antonio there are plenty of those, party on!Go to the bars and clubs, groc store (if not a dry county like mine), and liquor stores.

May be in high demand at certain times...my guess is end of the month or first couple days of the month when people are getting evicted.They are a nice size, they have handles and flip top lids, and they are STURDY.

Don't know the year and make of your car, but there are usually some service recommendations in your owners manual.  Always start there and see what things haven't been tended to in a while.Could be filters, tire pressure, spark plugs, correct warm-up times, etc.  Put some things on your calender when to do next.Next, take extra weight out of the car; some people drive around with at least an extra hundred pounds in the car.Trying for the "smooth driver award" is the best way to describe good gas mileage driving, no rapid starts, anticipating stoplights, etc.Leaving just a few minutes early for each trip gives you the option of not speeding, and the added benefit of being a safer driver.  Going faster  really burns lots of gas.Lastly, if you have a fuel injected car, you can turn off your engine for stops of over one minute.These steps can easily take in-town mileage from 15mpg to 20mpg, decreasing gas consumption and gas bills by 25%. <SEP> How do I improve my Gas mileage?

Get the thing running. Change the sand if you have a sand filter. Adjust Total Alkalinity and pH-- in that order. Nuke the pool with granular chlorine. Leave it running. Be sure to backwash/clean the filter frequently. If it doesn't seem to be getting better after a couple days then add a flocculant. Pour in the recommended amount for your pool and circulate about 2 hours. Then turn it off until all the gunk has settled to the bottom. At this point the water will be clear.

I'm an expert in this, stringing weed wackers.  here's what i do.    cut  the string to 6 ft and insert one end of string in the small hole on the spool.  now put spool in middle  of string and wind the 2 strings that are coming out of the spool counter clockwise until you have about 6 inches on either side of spool.  lock the ends of string in the slots, now insert the string into holes on weed eater head and turn spool in head until it locks in place.  this idea is best to follow so if you have a bump feed weed wacker you don't have to manually remove spool and unwind alittle to get more string.   hope this idea helps. feel free to rate my answer. <SEP> How to install weed trimmer string?

regular maintenance is the thing. Especially the oil change every 3000 miles. My toyota van has 242,000 miles on it, and my last one had 250k. Both even had head gasket leaks for over 50k miles! Oil changes, my friend, oil changes.Inline engines last longer in general than V or opposed cylinders, because they have more main bearings than cylinders. More cylinders last longer than less in general, because the wear and load is spread between more cylinders, so they wear slower.I had a 1970 Maverick with an inline 6 cylinder and a 1 bbl carb with automatic transmission. It would pretty much never die, because short of running out of one of the fluids, or forgetting to change one on time, you could never blow the motor even if you floored it everywhere you went. 1 barrel can't dump in enough gas to make it wind up harder than 7 main crank bearings could handle. That was the first car I ever got over 200,000 miles. (then i gave it to my sister and a gas attendant accidentally poured ATF into the brake fluid and all the rubber parts melted, rendering the brakes useless and more expensive than the entire car to replace. she had to give it to a cousin that does demolition derby). <SEP> how can i get 200,000 miles from my car? i want to know if there is anything additional to regular maintenance

None of the previous answers worked for me. Searching for -subject:re and equivalents seem to match EVERY conversation. I believe this is because that search is positive for the first message in the conversation (which does not have "Re:" in the subject line).  What works for me is:   Create a label (I called it "HasReply") using the filter: subject:(+re)  Then search for -label:hasreply or -label:hasreply -from:me   The logic here is that the first search will find all of the conversations with a reply. The second will then exclude those - leaving the messages without replies.  Adding the -from:me addresses a corner case where I'm searching a bunch of emails, sent NOT from me, to multiple recipients, and I want to find the ones NOBODY has replied to. Without the -from:me the results will for some reason include conversations where I am the only person who has replied. Adding this would not be appropriate in answering the original question, where the person wanted to find emails he had sent (which this would exclude) and had not received a reply to.  Alas, it is still not perfect. I create and apply the filter ("to matching conversations") and all is good. Then new replies come in and they don't seem to be added to the label...so I have to go back in like I'm editing the filter and re-apply it to catch the latest messages. <SEP> Search in Gmail - How to search the mails without reply?

first you have 2 hoses to hookup- the water hose and the hose that came with your pressure washer- the water hose is simple to figure out- the pressure washer hose is easy too once you know how - most pressure washers have slide couplers on them - their usually brass and the either slide forward or back - u have male and female adapters and you insert accordingly - make sure your spray gun is hooked up also- turn your water on, make sure you have fuel in your machine.  If you look down beside your fuel tank you should see the choke, throttle, on/off swicth, and possibly a primer- if theres a primer there will be instructions as to how many times to push it - turn your on/off switch to the on position- choke your carberator, again there should be directions as to where the choke position is - but after that you are ready to go - pull the rope and when it starts take it out of the choke position- usually it'll crank but cut off b/c the choke is on but once you get it running all you have to do is decide on what tip u want to use- your spray gun will have a lock on it so you may want to apply it while you're inserting it in your gun --- something good to remember is that the wider the tip opening, the wider the spray field- wide spraying tips are used for applying or misting the object before you pressure wash it, be extremely careful with tips that have small openings b/c they can cause serious damage to whatever you are spraying- i recommend using your #2 or #3 tip  -- you'll develop a feel for the spray gun fairly easy and then you'll be able to decide how close or far back you need to stand from an object to be effective- also remember to wear safety glasses <SEP> How to operate a craftsman 2550 pressure washer?

The drive belt (or belts) of a washing machine may become worn or damaged, causing noisy operation or stopping the washer entirely. A damaged drive belt is easy to replace. Remove the back panel of the washer to gain access to the belt. To remove the belt:Step 1: Loosen the bolt on the motor bracket and move the motor to put slack in the belt.Step 2: Remove the old belt and stretch a new one into place on the pulleys.Step 3: To put tension on the new belt, use a hammer handle or a short pry bar to push the motor into position while you tighten the bolt in the adjustable bracket. The belt should have about 1/2 inch deflection when you press on it at the center point, midway between the pulleys. If the belt is too loose, it will slip on the pulleys, causing the machine to malfunction. If the belt is too tight, it will wear very quickly and will probably become so hot that it will start to smoke or smell.Loose pulleys can also cause problems. Most pulleys are fastened to shafts with setscrews around the hub of the pulley. These screws must be tight or else the pulley or belt will slip. The resulting malfunction may seem to be caused by a faulty motor, but it can be corrected by tightening the pulleys and adjusting the belt. For this reason, always check the belts and pulleys before working on the motor. <SEP> How do i replace the fan belt on a washing machine? Its too tight to go on!?

There are many kinds of flush valve gaskets to choose from.  If you have a local plumbing supply they should have a better variety than a hardware store.  Take the original up there.  The old Cranes had a special gasket designed just for their toilets. It's thicker than the new universal gaskets that do not fit all toilets properly.  I think the old American Standard gaskets will work on crane,but don't take my word on that.  You do not want to tighten the nut to much or it will crack the tank. I tighten until the tank does not wiggle. <SEP> How do I repair a leaking toilet flush valve beveled gasket due to a chip in the edge of the mounting hole? I replaced the flush valve in an old Crane toilet. The original beveled gasket between the flush valve and the hole in the bottom of the tank was a softer material that sealed well despite there being a small chip in the inside tank edge of the flush valve mounting hole. The replacement flush valve uses a harder rubber beveled gasket that only contacts the edge of the tank hole, so water now leaks through the chipped area.I cannot tighten the flush valve locknut enough to compress the gasket to seal into the chipped area and cannot find a softer beveled gasket. I am thinking about filling in the chip with J B Weld to bring the surface back to normal. Would that work? Or should I try something different?

Try tightening the bolts holding water pump to block. I am assuming the pump is installed into the block and not remote mounted.  The leak could also be coming from the weep hole in the pump (small hole in the pump casing) - in which case the seal is leaking and you must replace the pump.You can try the siver leak stuff but it will gum up the rest of the cooling system - not the best idea.If tightening bolts and silver leak stuff fail it is time to pull pump and change the gasket and us a little Permatex when installing the new gasket or o-ring(type dependant).  If you go though the hassle of pulling the pump it is also a good idea to just change the water pump while you are there as the price of the pump is small compared to time involved in changing the pump. (After fixing the gasket the pump could fail next week and you will have to pull it again).Hope this helps. <SEP> how to stop coolant leak?

I'm not sure what brand of edger you have, but I experienced a similar issue with an old walk behind craftsman edger I had. It was a three wheel with a three tip blade. What I did was to put a piece of wood (2x4 or something similar) underneather the blade. This allows the blade to 'grip' something without damaging the blade itself. (I also use this method for our commercial mower blades)Once the wood is under the blade, I put my knee (or any applicable pressure onto the top cover that went over the blade.

Be very leery of using anything that could harm your pipes. Because of the age and your statement about drainage issues I would suggest calling out a plumber with camera equipment to asses the whole line to make sure you don't have breakage or root intrusion into the pipe.

You can use the chisel and hammer method, or even a rotary hammer to do it but if you do this you risk damaging the concrete blocks.  My advice would be to rent a Concrete Saw (the back end looks like a chainsaw and it will have a 10-14" diamond blade on the front end).  Cut the grout line down the middle and try to avoid angling the blade.  To help you cut a straight line you can get a 4 1/2" grinder and a diamond blade for it (the diamond blades can be expensive i'll warn you) and use it to score the grout) if worse comes to worse you can get a 7" diamond blade and throw it on a skilsaw and use it set to a very, very shallow depth to cut your score line.This is a physically harder way of doing it but you'll have a much lower risk of busting blocks which if you used a rotary drill and chisel you almost certainly would.  I also doubt it takes much to cut through the grout. <SEP> How do I take appert cement blocks that have been cemented together?

You really need a factory service manual for this.  The steering column is mounted to the vehicle at the factory as unit.  That means the wiper, signal lever is already installed on the steering column when it is put into the truck.  Depending on the make and model, it may be necessary to remove the entire steering column from the vehicle to disassemble the wiper, signal switches.  You may get lucky and have a cover or shroud on the column that will give you access to the connectors.  If you are having trouble with the switches on the lever itself, I believe the column has to come out.  Sorry it isn't a five minute job.....and please be careful with airbags!  Be sure to remove negative cable from the battery before attempting any electrical repairs.

If you mean 'popcorn' texture you will need to know what type of texture was used on the ceiling. Although I don't believe anybody uses Asbestos in residential buildings anymore it is still legal to do so and was used through the 1980's in a lot of construction. The laws against Asbestos only forbid it from being developed into new types of products. There are currently dozens of things that Asbestos can be used in legally. If you cannot be sure that your texture is not made from Asbestos you should have a professional contractor remove your texture for you.That said, if you have a steamer spraying the ceiling a little to soften the texture then scraping gently with a spatula (6" is a good size) to remove the popcorn. You could also use a damp sponge with warm water before scraping. Just be careful not to gouge the ceiling with the corner of the spatula. <SEP> How do I remove textured paint from my ceiling?

Take precautions for protecting carpets or flooring as the water in the radiator may be black. Close both valves, noting if the lock shield valve is only part open,  slacken the nut between the valve and the radiator at one each, catch the water into a dish until the radiator is empty. open vent to aid draining. when empty remove connection at the other end and plug with tissue as there will always be a last drop, remove first end slackened and plug. close vent up, lift rad off brackets and turn upside down.   Replace in revers using jointing paste on valve connections, open one valve and vent the radiator recharging the system if its a sealed system ( combi boiler) when the radiator is full close vent and open the other valve.

If you are framing or not you need to run a stud on the concrete where you intend to attach it. You drill holes through your (plate) the floor piece to match the holes you drill in the concrete with a masonry bit. You will need some (anchors) that fit the holes you drilled into the concrete. you hammer them in flush with the surface of the concrete. When you buy the anchors it's best to buy the masonry bit at the same time so the sizes are comparable. The anchors should be just about as large as the masonry bit but the should fit snug when tapped into the concrete floor. Then you lay your plate or stud over the sunken anchors. The holes should match up with the anchors providing that you drilled them with the plate in place thus marking your anchors position on the floor. Then your anchors come equipped with the Bolts that you run through the plate and into the concrete which now makes you hire-able in one construction trade. Good luck. <SEP> How do you anchor wood or metal studs into concret floor?
would not recommend muffs on an inboard engine. if ya do, do not run the engine much above idle RPMs. muffs and a water hose cannot suppy enough water fast enough to properly cool your engine. as they are not the most efficient means. normally only one side of the intake is fed, and more water is lost than actually taken in.its ok for simple things like, just flushing through, after salt water use, or maybe to winterize, but for any major operation, where high rpms are required, id hook the water hose up to the engine, directly. depending on engine and set up, will depend on where to hook the hose to. probably have better luck, asking a local marine shop, who probably can tell you depending on your engine.not all sterndrives use a leg fed water intake, which muffs are designed to fit over, like on outboards. some use pick up tubes, which muffs are useless on. <SEP> How do you hook up a water line to an inboard engine to run it out of water.?

First make sure you have no loose components like tierod ends and balljoints, if they are all ok and the play is in the steering box you can adjust the play out aslong as the box isn't badly worn, there is a nut with a set screw in the middle of it on top of the box, find an allen wrench and a box end 5/8 wrench hold the set screw with the allen wrench and loosen the nut a little then hold the nut still and turn the set screw clockwise 1/4 of a turn and hold the allen wrench and tighten the nut, test the wheel play and see if it helped you may need to do it some more but if you need turn it more than 1 full turn clockwise then the box needs replaced. <SEP> how do you tighten the play in a steering wheel on a 76 gmc pickup? too much play.can't keep it on the road.

Wow.  You've gotten some crazy answers on this question.  Cinnamon?   Nutmeg?  Sugar water?  Standing water?   That's nuts.  Literally.Here's what to do.  Truck down to your local Lowe's and pick up a couple different brands of ant spray.  Check the active ingredients and try to get different brands that use different stuff.  You might also pickup a Summer Blend of lawn fertilizer with insert treatment.  Scott's Step #3.  Spray one brand of the ant spray around the outside perimeter of your home, including garage, etc.  Heavier around areas that are damp, door thressholds, etc.  Repeat in about a week with the other brand.Take the other brand and spray afflicted areas indoors including baseboard areas near where ants have been spotted.  Repeat in about a week with the other brand.Put the Scotts stuff down on the lawn with a broadcast spreader.Ants are hardy and persistent creatures that are attracted to food and standing water.  A couple rounds of the sprays ought to do it.  Might need a third week of spray.  Good luck. <SEP> How do i deal with ants that keep coming back!?

Frost-King makes one that is very simple to install.  It's "U" shaped and adjustable.  Measure your door width.  Most doors are either 2/10 or 3/0, that is 34" or 36".  Go to the hardware store or home center and buy a sweep that will fit your door.The sweep will usually be slightly wider than your doo so you will need a hacksaw to trim the excess.

Very carefully. If your car has a distributor ignition system. You must keep it water tight or your car may not run any more. Also make sure to cover up the carb or throttle body if you have one. Watch how you spray around the alternator, it could also get damaged. I would recommend using a low pressure water hose. After all of that I would start with something like a spray one Mean Green degreaser or a good foaming degreaser. Then rise and use a good metal polish on valve covers and anything else metal, then use an armor all protectant for hoses and any plastic trim you may have. By this time your engine sound look like new. You can also add some detailing features like spray painting any thing that may look old and dull. Painting your block is also a nice touch.

I'm assuming you mean a standard dial type fan limit control. With the power in the off position, and holding the dial stationary, move the lower dial indicator to about 100 degrees and the higher number to about 150 degrees. The higher number is the temperature the fan will turn on and the lower number is the temp it turns off. Of course these settings can be changed for personal comfort, but these are a good start point.

First of all, an '88 Bronco is not worth anywhere near $3500.00. Try more like 1500-2000 IF it is REALLY nice. The rebuilt engine adds zero value. When the engine died, it was worth Zero. The fixed engine restored the value to the previous condition. A good rule is that if a vehicle is more than 80% depreciated, if the repair cost will exceed half the value of the vehicle, throw it away and get a different vehicle. For example, your Bronco sold for about 14,000 when new. It is now worth about $2,000.00 Therefore it is 85% depreciated. It is a close call, but I would be tempted to sell it for whatever I could get and take $4,000 and buy a newer vehicle. Fire your Mechanic. These Broncos are inexpensive to work on. Sounds to me like he is taking advantage of you. V8 engine repair bills are not higher than any other type of engine, and the 4wd has nothing to do with any repair that is not part of the 4wd system. If your mechanic thinks it is a great truck then sell it to him. And FIRE HIM IMMEDIATELY!!! A Good Mechanic will never tell someone whether or not a repair is worth doing. He will Educate and inform, but should NEVER make that judgement call. Interesting that the Judgement call he favors is YOU spend BIG MONEY with HIS REPAIR SHOP!!! Does he have a Kid in College? A new Corvette to pay for?   Good Luck! <SEP> How do you decide when to quit spending more money to keep your used car running? Currentley, I have spent 1,000.00 American to keep a 3,500.00 used car running. I could sell it for three thousand and five or spend another 800.00. If I spend the eight, the mechanic assures me it will be fine. Until the next time it developes another problem. I know this is difficult to answer without all the specs but I am just looking for a general answer. I would be grateful for any help I get. I have an '88 Bronco with a rebuilt engine. I can afford to but another used car for 5,000. but I wonder if it will be any better. Also, I don't know to much about cars, how to select a good used, that is. The mechanics assure me the bills are high because it is a V-8 with 4-wheel drive and worth the money. What with gas prices and all, I am beginning to wonder if I should just get something else. Please Help. I appreciate your answers.

Just cut the wire(Breaker off) Get a junction box and make up the three blacks 3 whites and three greens(or bare) wires.

If you don't want to go to Autozone for your answer. Try these steps:1) Take the rear tire off2) Take the brake calipers off, but leave the brake line fastened. Use a small piece of rope to fasten the caliper away from the work area. 3) Take the brake rotor offYou should see the workings of the parking brake by this time. It is basically like any drum brake system but smaller. Usually, there is no wear on the brake shoes because they are rarely used except for parking. Make sure there is no unusual wear on the shoes. If there is, then replace the brake shoes.If there is a problem with the parking brake, it is usually when the brake is set because the tensioner has loosened ands the shoes aren't closing on the drums. The parking brake uses a cable system that runs through a tensioner that should be located under the car along the drive axel and just ahead of rear transaxel case. The brake shoes should be completly closed when the parking brake is set and completely free when it is released. Adjust accordingly if this is not the case.

Sounds like you are referring to the wheel and not the tire. The tire is the rubber part. Bicycle wheel bearings can be adjusted using tools called cone wrenches. A cone wrench is a very flat wrench that will hold the cone-shaped bearing surface steady while a jam nut is tighted. The cone can be turned to tighten it up so that there is no play, but the wheel still spins easily. Then, using a cone wrench, hold the cone steady while you tighten the jam nut. Not all bearings are adjustable this way. Some may need to be replaced as a unit, which could require pressing the bearing out and pressing a new bearing in. Finally, it should be noted that the bearing is not always the cause for a shaky wheel. It could be that the wheel is not true, and/or is out of round. Truing a wheel can be done with a spoke wrench and some patience. An out of round wheel will probably need to be replaced. <SEP> How can I tighten or repair bicycle tire bearing? my back bike tire is shaking and i know it's not suppose to do that. how can i fix it without having to get a whole new tire.

The heat was probably off for the season (when it was cold).Now that its on, it sounds like your thermostat is broken.Remember getting upset won't help to get this fixed.. so you need to talk to the landlord and mention that you believe the thermostat is broken, and that there is more heat than you need is coming into the apartment. Remind him/her how expensive the heat costs are.Note this may take a day/two to fix. In the meantime, turn on some fans, or simply open a window (just a crack - periodically) you don't want to LOOSE all your heat.

Working on AC & Heat is like wiring a house, you have to complete the circuit. With AC work you basicly have three circuits low voltag (24vac) High (120/240vac or better) and then freon.

So much for all these so called "trained technicians"......The motor will run if 180 out but not well.  I have done this simply to proove a  point and get a few bucks.  It will NOT dammage the engine.  Many of the people on here do not have a clue and answer out of ignorance.  You need to check anything you have removed or replaced (cam, distributor, etc.)  If everything checks out well then the problem is most likely in the ignition.

Tree sap is basically sugar water with traces of protein.

I agree with the above for how you figure the yardage.  If you're ordering for a slab then you'll take the square footage of the slab then take that times the depth in feet (if it's 4" thick then 0.33').  If it's a wall same principle, take the length of the wall times the height times the thickness.If you're using an 80 pound bag of concrete mix (includes cement, sand, and coarse aggregates) then the yield is going to depend on how much water you add, but i'd say you're probably going to get about 2/3rds to 3/4's of a cubic foot out of each bag depending on the amount of water you add. <SEP> how do you calculate cement yardage?

the most common AFCI devices sre installed in the circuit breaker box. just like the standard circuit breaker. check the switch on the AFCI to see if it is tripped. If it is then turn it off then turn it back on it should work.If you have a AFCI receptacle, which is a outlet, in the room (it will be the one that is way different than the others) You may have to get a AFCI/GFCI combination tester from a hardware store. If it has a reset button on it, press the button and test it. If it does not work press the test button then press the reset button again if it still does not work and the circuit breaker has not been tripped then you may have to replace the AFCI receptacle.

You have a vacuum leak somewhere - the computer is using the idle air control motor to try and compensate for that leak.  Check for cracked or disconnected vacuum lines or air intake hoses.  If you don't find anything, you can CAREFULLY spray small amounts of carburetor cleaner on and around the intake and vacuum hoses - when you hit the leak with the carb cleaner the idle will smooth out - be CAREFUL doing this - spraying it on a hot exhaust can cause a fire - carb cleaner is flammable - that's why the idle will smooth out - it's using the carb cleaner for fuel.It is remotely possible the idle air control motor is clogged with carbon or bad, but usually it's a vacuum leak.

If the furnace is appropriately sized, then yes.  If you are comfortable in doing the work where you are confident that you won't have a gas leak and a drip tube exists and have good wiring skills, then it's that simple.

Eichler homesare a unique design from a unique period and location.

HONEST ANSWERS.......Here goes.......Do you both rent? That would make things real simple. Being a Landlord myself, I know of what you speak.That's how they happen, a bathroom leak usually comes down in the downstairs living room, sometimes their small because if the drywall is solid or even new, water will actually sit in a puddle, depending on the size of the leak. First of all, go down there and tell him to show you the damage, usually the ceiling below the leak will be stained, kinda brown, from the drywall being wet. Before you do that,flush your toilet,make sure everything is quiet, listen for running water or drips. That kind of damage can be real bad,if there is water, it will soak the drywall, eventually it could all come down. Like I said in the beginning, if you both rent, it's the landlords problem, if he owns the house, make sure you see it, if you can't do it, get someone YOU KNOW to take care of it.......Hit Answers up again, I'll be looking for you.

You need a basic understanding of the risks involved, but it's easy to do:There should be a bleed valve where the fuel line goes into the furnace...open it up, eventually fuel should start dripping out (put a small glass container under to catch).If you don't have a bleed valve, loosen the fuel line itself where it connects, fuel will start to leak out.Another alternative, if your furnace has a manual reset that will make it run for about a minute, and then shut off due to air the line, keep resetting until it keeps running.  Let it sit for at least a minute in between resets, so you don't overheat the pump. <SEP> How do I bleed the oil Line to the Pump? I ran the Oil barrel Dry. I need to start the boiler again.?

FIRST READ THIS ANSWER.DO NOT GO DIGGIN IN YOUR UNIT FOR FOOD OR ANYTHING.Under most units there is a alan screwWhen you get the unit installed they will give you a alan set wrench to unclog the unit.all you have to do is make sure the power is off and put the wrench in the bottom (its next to the reset) and turn it back and forth this will losein what is in the unit. If you cant turn it and its stuck really good then you need to get all the water out of the sink use a shop vac- then look inside to see what it is. and go from thereThe reason i say dont just put your hand in because Im a plumber and I have seen many people get cut really bad because a spoon or something got in the unit and they put there hand in to grab it and got cut. You have to remember there are a set of blades in the unit also They are n ot sharp per say but over time they could get that way.Also a good thing to have on hand Is a Garbage disposal wrench ( it looks like the letter T with a moon shape pc on the bottom. What this does You insert it into the top of the unit and it fits between the blades and you move it back and forth. Just like the wrench under the unit but this 1 is alot more easy to use. And you could get this at and hardware store for 10 bucks.1 Last thing if the unit is bad due to a spoon and it got ruined Go buy a ISE Unit at home depot they ahve about 6 differnt ones there you want to buy 1/2 horse it will set you back bout 100bucks. But the good thing about these units are they have auto reverse. What this means is when you turn the unit on it works normal but when you shut it off it spins in reverse (this is done to reduce the risk of a jam in the unit) and also ISE is the best out there for home use. And I hate to say this but if you have a GD like a bone crusher or anything like that THEY ARE NOT WORTH 5 Bucks. They might seem to work but they do not chop the food into very small pc they are alot bigger, And this in time will cause the line to get cloged And you dont need that. <SEP> How can I fix my garbage disposal?

The best way to do this from my experience is to tie a function to a button/image. The only drawback is that you cannot pass parameters along with a script assigned to a button. Due to this you will need to make a function specific to each navigation but they can call be a in a single script file.  Steps:  Create an image (Insert -> image) and style it to your preference  Create a custom function with the following:  function showSheetByName(Name) {    var ss = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();    var sheet = ss.getSheetByName(Name);    SpreadsheetApp.setActiveSheet(sheet); }  and then a function specific to your button  function showSheet5() {    showSheetByName("Sheet5"); }  Finally assign this function to your button  Assign Script... showSheet5  You should now be able to click on your button and navigate to "Sheet5". This can also be modified to go to a specific area of the sheet as well. <SEP> Link to specific sheet in Google spreadsheet
Spray some brake cleaner or carb cleaner....etc. around the seals and see if it affects the engine.It sounds like you may have some trash in the carb though... take it off and apart and blow it out with compressed air and carb cleaner through any and all holes you see.

You have to fine tune it when its warmed up till it revs up and down with little to no hesitation. <SEP> How do I adjust the carburator on my gas edger? My craftsman edger has a 3 hp gas motor that has gone out of adjustment.

I have only 1 needle adjust screw in the bowl of the carb but can't seem to get it set at a level that will both enable easy idling and revving to cut.  Truthfully, I don't know for sure if the adjustment is the cause of the surging or if it's something else (vaccuum?) but any input would be appreciated.
Unclogging a Shower Drain Topic: Home Improvement > Bathroom   2004-05-14 | Post Feedback! | Send to Friend | Print Version | Send Me Responses | Related  When the drains in our house get sluggish, here's what I do. Pour some baking soda in the drain (about 1/2 cup), then about the same amount of white vinegar. Immediately pour in a couple cups of boiling water, and plunge with the plunger.

Remove the #1 spark plug on the drivers side in the front of motor.  With the distributor cap off bump the starter to determine which way the rotor turns.  Clean the timing marks and indicator on the harmonic balancer and timing chain cover.  Make a mark at 8 degrees BTC (before top dead center) or which ever the tag on the vehicle says to time it on.  It will be from 5-10 degrees BTC.  Make another mark on the balancer that is 0 degrees or (Top Dead Center) TDC.  While someone else bumps the starter over, cover the #1 plug hole with your thumb until it blows your finger off.  At this point you want to turn off the ignition switch and turn the engine (by hand) in whichever direction it takes to bring it to TDC or 0 degrees.  On the top of the intake you will find the firing order.  Make a note of this order, and check later on.  Your distributor should be pointing at or just before the number one plug wire on the cap.  This should be with the rotor pointing towards the front of the engine.  If it is out of place you need to remove the distributor, turn it to where its hitting the notch that is before the #1 on the cap.  Remember it wil go down more when it goes into the oil pump.  You can use a long screwdriver to turn the oil pump to where the distributor goes all the way down.  With it all the way down, you should be able to turn the distributor and make the rotor point some on both sides of the #1 on the cap.  If It does not do this, then you need to move to another slot until it will sweep both before and after the #1 on the cap.  This will align your vacuum chamber to where it doesn't hit something when you are done.  Turn the distributor till it is just a few degrees before the #1 on the cap, and the distributor is down all the way in the oil pump.  Put the hold down on, and tighten the bolt to where you can turn the distributor but with a little effort to do so.  Don't forget to put the gasket under the distributor or it will leak oil.  Now check the firing order in the direction the rotor turns.  Starting in the front of the engine toward the headlights on the drivers side, the #1 will be the first one.  The second one on that same side will be #3, and #5 and #7.  From front to back on the other side of the engine it will be #2, and #4, and #6, and #8.  After you have checked the firing order, you are now ready to start the engine.  Have something like a wet blanket or towel handy in case you are out a notch and it backfires through the carburetor, as this can make a fire.  If it doesn't start right away, you are in the wrong notch, and will have to remove the distributor and start over.  Remove the #1 plug, get it on the compression stroke, see if the rotor is point at or just before the #1 plug wire on the cap.  If you have it there then you are in the correct notch.  It is easy to get off one notch and this can be a pain to get right, but you should be able to fire the engine without grinding on it.  I should start right up, and run pretty good.  Now use a timing light when you get the engine warmed up to operating temperature and the idle speed at about 750-800 RPM.  Plug the vacuum hose that goes to the distributor, and adjust the timing to spec's, or about 8-10 degrees BTC.  Glad I could help.  Good Luck!!! <SEP> how to time a 73 pontiac 350?

Just because the car's lights work doesn't necessarily mean the battery is fine.Does the car turn over? A starter motor (electrical) actually turns your engine when you are trying to start your car. If when you put the key in and try to start the car and you hear no sound at all, or maybe a click and then no sound, it would either be your starter motor has died and it needs to be replaced, or your battery can't give enough amps to the starter motor to start up the car.I would recommend doing this in this order.1. Check the fluid level in the battery. If the fluid is low in the battery fill with distilled water up to the necessary levels.2. Have someone try to jump start your car with a pair of jumper cables. Let the good engine run for a minute to try to place a charge in your battery. If your car starts up, then the battery is what was dying, or you were low on electrolyte (what the water you added to the battery becomes). Drive the car for about 10 minutes to charge up the battery. Don't use any accessories if possible (ie turn off radio/head lights and anything electrical). If you turn off your car and it starts back up, your done.If trying to jump start the car and it doesn't turn over or all you hear is a ping or click sound, then your starter motor is most likely the problem. You'll have to get the starter motor replaced. <SEP> how do you troubleshoot a 1996 sable that will not start? Battery seems to be working, has lights, radio etc.

Even though the vehicle is under OBDII standards, switch the ignition off, then you can go to the plug in, located under the steering column (usually to the right), remove the cap if there is one, and use a paper-clip, bend the paper-clip into a "U" and insert it into the very first two openings, the top and the bottom on the first column. Then switch the ignition back on and watch your check engine light, it should flash "one" then "one, two, three" indicating 13 that it is being read, it will flash "13" 3 times. Then it will flash the code, "one, two, three" and "one, two, three" would inicate diagnostic trouble code "33." It will flash each code 3 times, and then move on to the next code. You'll have to watch the check engine light, and steady look at it, and count how many times is flashes to see what trouble code it is displaying. Then you can lookup "Diagnostic Trouble Codes" for your particular vehicle make/model on the internet.Or you can take it to Autozone, and they'll plug it in and check it for you, or any shop or dealership will be able to check it as well.The easiest, and best way to clear the trouble codes is to disconnect the battery cables, you can leave them off for maybe 5 minutes, and it will wipe out the memory. It will also erase the radio presets, which you can easily reset by selecting a station, and holding down the preset number. Most receivers will show memory or programmed or something showing you that the preset has been recorded. However, if the problem has not been rectified, then the light will reappear. So, you can use the paper-clip method or take it to someone who can plug it in, and read the code. It would probably be best to read the code before you clear it, even if it doesnt come back, just to know why it was there. <SEP> how do I reset the service&#92;check engine light on a 98 ford escort lx&#92;le?

I have figured out a way to get them out via forwarding them, using a browser scripting tool call iMacros.  I think this macro will only work with Firefox 3.6 which you can get from this link .  I wont go into installing and setting either of them up, but here is the macro I used.  VERSION BUILD=7300701 RECORDER=FX TAB T=1 FRAME F=4 TAG POS=1 TYPE=SPAN ATTR=CLASS:hE&&TXT:Reply WAIT SECONDS=.5 TAG POS=1 TYPE=TEXTAREA FORM=NAME:NoFormName ATTR=NAME:to CONTENT=test@GMAIL.COM TAG POS=1 TYPE=DIV ATTR=TABINDEX:1&&ROLE:button&&TXT:Send WAIT SECONDS=3 TAG POS=1 TYPE=IMG ATTR=ALT:&&SRC:images/cleardot.gif&&CLASS:iHkD0e&&TXT: WAIT SECONDS=2  Just replace 'test@gmail.com' with the email address you want to forward to.  Now the only other key piece of advice is where to start the loop of the macro.  To do it right, you will want to create a label and assign all your gmail chats to it.  This will allow you to see your chats in chronological order and forward them that way.  Then in gmail click on the label, when the list opens it will likely open to the newest first.  Therefore, go the the last page of the labels contents.  Open the last item.  here is when you click "play loop" in iMacros.  I had 1k chats to export.  You'll notice there are "wait" statements in the code, this will give the browser time to keep up. They may need tweaking.  Also, check back every couple of minutes, because it sometimes throws an error, or tries to move to the next (newer) chat before the email has been sent.  Just click "cancel" and it will go back to the script and the email will have been sent.  If it throws any other errors during operation, you should be able to adjust the loop duration and start it again with no problems.  This has been aggravating me for so long since I switched Gmail accounts due to spam, so I am finally happy to close that account having got all my content out. <SEP> How can I export my Google chat logs?

Hi, one of the porters at a dealer i used to work at showed me that a finishing rubbing compound works great, and wont hurt the factory finish,              this is not regular rubbing compound that is too abrasive,  finishing is almost as smooth as wax and also has the same shine and protection that you get from car wax, but will remove deep stains with rubbing, and help in keeping the next layer of brake dust from sticking, this is the brand used, 3M Finesse-It II Machine Polish, cost 13 bucks. <SEP> How do i safely clean my stock wheels on my '89 camaro?

You take a class in automobile air conditioning and become certified.

Use a straight blade to apply drywall compound to each side of the corner.  Crease the tape and press lightly into the corner.  Smooth it out with the corner trowel.  Most inexperienced drywallers apply too much compound when laying in the tape and also try to acheive a finished look with just one application.  When done properly, the tape will be embedded in the compound but not covered with compound.  When the compound is dry, apply a second coat the same way but skip the application of the tape.  Practice in a closet where mistakes won't be noticeable.Good luck with your project. <SEP> how do I apply drywall plaster to corners?

Fortunately it's easy, if a little repetitive, to get the stains out. Here's how. Steps In a spray bottle, mix up a solution of 1/2 warm water and 1/2 white vinegar. Spray the stained area with the solution. Press a dry terrycloth towel over the wet area. Remove the towel when it's soaked. Repeat until the stains are gone. Tips If you don't want to spend a whole day doing this, apply the solution whenever you happen to be driving. Just remember to remove the towel promptly and let the carpet dry out. Don't be discouraged by a deep-rooted stain. It will come out eventually. Warnings Avoid the temptation to rub the stained area. It doesn't help and may damage the carpetFROM ABOUThttp://trucks.about.com/cs/autodetailing/ht/removesalt.htmHow To Get the Salt OutFrom Dale Wickell,Your Guide to Trucks / SUVs.FREE Newsletter.

I am attempting to install about 90 feet of french drains along the interior perimeter of my basement directing torwards a sump pump basin. I have already used a laser level to find the low spot (pump location) and have a pretty go idea about the layout of the system. The plan was to create an 8" wide ditch (8" to 10" deep) along the perimeter and fill with gravel and corrugated 4" drain pipe. There is a "cloth wrap" available that installs over the pipe to prevent dirt and debris from ever clogging the pipe perferations. Once the pitch is established the pipes will be directed into the sump pump basin. The sump basin is a standard "sump pump basin" from Lowes or Home Depot with a 1/2hp pump with float auto-activation.When everything is put into place, I will back-fill with more gravel and then patch trench with cement leaving a 1/2 inch gap along the wall for any water from the walls to drain in to.I need help on the proper tools and prep work as well as supplies to use.

get a timing light, connect to battery and #1 cylinder.  find your timing marks on the pulleys at the bottom of the engine. mark with some white out, then with the engine running, aim the timing light at the mark and twist the distributor until they line up.  if this isn't working for you then you'r timing is waayyyy off and you need to set the base timingpull the valve cover, locate #1 cylinder, then rotate with a breaker bar on the end of the crankshaft pulley until your #1 cylinder is at top dead center (tdc).  then reinstall your distributor with the rotor pointing to the #1 point in the distributor cap.  re-assemble, leave the distributor loose enough you can twist it around and then fine tune the timing iwth the timing gunis this a newer car with fuel injection.  most don't allow you to adjust the timing.  what you do is set to a particular timing of say 0 or 10 before top dead center.  then as you drive, the engine computer takes over advancing and retarding the timing as necessary under driving conditionsif you're having trouble setting the timing it could be that the computer is trying to set it at the same time.  my ford has something called a "spout connector" which is just a jumper.  by disconnecting i disable the computer timing temporarily, allowing me to set the timing to 10btdc.  once that's done i plug the jumper back in, start the truck and the timing is now within range for the computer. <SEP> How do you set the timing on a Corsa 3 cylinder 1.0L?

In order to estimate how many shingles you'll need, first you need to estimate  the total square footage of your roof's surface. Just measure the length and width of each plane on the roof, including dormers. Then, multiply length x width to get the square footage of each plane. Simply add the square footage of each of the planes together to derive the total square footage of your roof.EXAMPLE:Plane 1: 120' x 100' = 12,000 sq. ft.Plane 2: 120' x 100' = 12,000 sq. ft.Plane 1 + Plane 2 = 24,000 sq. ft. for the total square footage of the roof.Roof surfaces are measured in "squares." A "square" is an area of roof which measures 100 square feet. To determine the number of squares on the gable roof above, for example, simply divide its total of 24,000 square feet by 100. Which means you will need 240 "squares" of shingles to cover it. The most common type of shingle, called a three-tab or strip shingle, is generally packaged three bundles per square.If this is a new roof, you will also need 240 squares of underlayment (no underlayment is needed if you are applying shingles directly over an existing asphalt roof).

Then you will be able to pull out -with lots of force sometimes req'd - the stem. best to WD-40 first. Actually, if it's a Moen, go to supply house & look at diagram to  see what I'm talking about or go to moen.com.  if it's standard faucet w/either 2 or 4 handles : remove screw, pull off handle. Large tub gear puller may be required ($5-6).  Then remove stem using the appropriate socket (sold in a kit of 5 or 6 for about $8) for removing tub stems.

You have to use a programmer or a chip. On that new of a Chevy you can't just remove it.

Every outlet in the building needs to be opened up to allow the trapped air out of the lines.  Until you do this, it will continue to make the groaning noise.  Does it make a banging noise when you suddenly shut off the tap?  If it does, talk to a plumber type dude at Lowes, or a hardware store, and ask about a valve that stops this from happening.  You might install one of these valves, and it will resolve the problem.  I have seen some stranger things happen.  Mybe you could call ghost busters lol?  I hope this help you in some way.  Good Luck!!!Part 2:You are right, if the water was off because of the landslide, and the water is brown, then I would say there is a lot of air in the lines coming from the supply.  Until all this air works its way out of the system, you will have noise.  I hate to tell you this as I know you wanted to hear something more positive, but it sounds like the whole system has air in it.  Sometimes the water can have a lot of air in it and it will take on a brown tint.  Try this; run some water into a clear glass, and let it set for an hour or two, and see if the water clears up.  Also; put some in a white tea cup, and let it set for an hour.  If its mud in the water the cup will have brown tint on the white glass that you can wipe off with a paper towel.  Usually when there is one there is the other.  If the clear glass of water gets clear after a while, then it may be air instead of dirt.  You can also run some through a coffee filter, and see what it looks like.  It can take some time for it to go away if it is that much air in the system.  Ask your neighbors if they are having the same kind of problem.  I'll bet they are.Good Luck!!! <SEP> How do I stop my bathroom pipes from making a loud trembling sound?

[taken verbatim from ehow]For more info and many tips from people with the same problem.. follow the link at the source. I hope it helps!1.   Use the toilet as little as possible once you notice there's a problem. This will help prevent overflow and water damage.    2.   Insert a plunger into the toilet, making sure the rubber globe or cup is fully seated over the drain opening.    3.   Push down on the plunger handle with firm but careful strokes. Rough, careless use can damage the toilet bowl. If the clog isn't too tight, these bursts of increased water pressure will probably clear the obstruction.    4.   Attack tougher problems with a snake (see "eHow to Use a Plumber's Snake').    5.   Consider a drain cleaner only as a last resort. Make sure that any product used is specifically marked as safe for use with porcelain, and follow the manufacturer's directions carefully. Never mix any of these chemical agents, as dangerous reactions could occur.    6.   Flush the toilet several times to remove the drain cleaner and to check the flow. <SEP> how to unclog a toilet?

Theres a couple of things you can do, if the roof is a simple 4 hip roof you can do the math yourself using a formula like stated above, basically just just multipy WxH then divide by 2. If it's a more complicated hip roof with valleys, dormers, bump-outs and gables, you'd be better off using a construction calculator or some estimating software. Heres a link to some software with a free trial:http://craftsman-book.com/downloads/download.php?download_id=46Another idea would be to call out some roofers to give you some bids. Contractors usually don't charge for estimates and should include all the info you need, including a material list. If you decide to not go with a contractor, you'd at least have an idea of how to proceed.edit: This site is pretty straight forward and easy to understand regarding the calculation of different style roofs:http://www.roofhelp.com/measuring.htm <SEP> how to calculate the area of a hipped roof?

The way you describe it, I assume you took two very long lengths of chain and tried to throw them over the tree limb, and ending up with 2 hanging lengths of chain on each side of your swing. This is more difficult to get to swing because as you try to swing, one side of the chain fights with the other side. What you need to do is loop the chain over the limb, then you need to attach the end of the chain to a link iin the chainup by the limb, so that a single strand of chain hangs down to your swing. This arrangement would give you 2 strands of chain total hanging from the limb, one for each side of the swing. It should work fine like this. <SEP> How do you make a swing swing from a tree? I have two chains over a limb.  On the chains there is rubber at the top to protect the tree limb.  The problem is now the swing doesn't swing because there is no give at the top.

If the problem isn't in the areator, I would have to say that it is indeed clogged somewhere between the water line hookups and the faucet's head.  There is a chance that silt has built up inside the actual faucet and is clogged somewhere in there.  You might consider turning off the water to that sink, taking apart the faucet (really simple, email me if you need help) and running some drano through the faucet itself.

Many central heating systems last 25 years or more. You didn't mention what type of furnace you have, forced air, hot water and what type of fuel it burns (gas, oil, electricity, propane, wood, coal, etc). Other factors are whether you have air conditioning, a separate domestic hot water heater or combined boiler and domestic hot water heat. Because of rapidly rising energy costs, one approach you can take is to compare the costs of running your current utilities versus how much you could save by upgrading to newer more energy efficient appliances. A 16 year old heat pump or refrigerator for example should definitely be replaced with new energy efficient models that only cost half as much to run. This assumes you don't plan on moving to a new house in the next 10 years or so. New condensation type gas fired hot air furnaces run so efficiently (90%) that they only need a plastic PVC pipe for a flue. <SEP> How to know is time to change a new Furnace ?

Oil it.  I would not put a clear finish on it.  Get a good quality furniture oil for light wood, it should be about the color of honey.  Clean off the dust with compressed air.  Oil it and let it soak in for a month.  Use wooden pegs and drilling to repair cracks.  OK no oil, I just love the natural finish though.No oil:  Change your work schedule and work in the wettest time of the year for your area after your trunk has had a chance to soak up some humidity.  Don't wet it  (although a wash might not hurt) unless you plan on sanding it.  Just make sure it's evenly exposed. prop it up in the air if necessary.  Hang up the wash nearby, etc.  Try using larger clamps and protect your trunk with pieces of scrap wood between it and the clamps.

There are several types of sightglass'.  One has glass on both sides of a round brass-looking body.  It may have a dot in it.  If the dot looks magnified, the system is full.  If there are bubbles in it more than a minute or two after the compressor starts running, the charge is low.  If the bubbles are constant, or if the dot does not look magnified, the system is empty.The other type has a round center in the body of the sightglass, and just the top is glass, and it will have a colored dot in the center; this dot is the moisture indicator.  This dot varies in color depending on the manufacturor of the sightglass, but usually should have a plastic cap that covers the sightglass to keep it clean.  The cap will tell what color is normal and what color it will change to if it senses moisture in the system.  If it indicates moisture, have it checked by a pro; moisture can react with the chemical makeup of the refrigerant, and can form an acid, which can reek havoc on your compressor, and that can be very expensive to repair.  Getting rid if the moisture now will be cheaper than a new comp., or new unit <SEP> how do i read my central air sightglass?

Corian counter tops are made of material that is the same, all the way thru... so... to eliminate cuts, scratches, etc... some light sanding is all that is required.

Use a damp cloth before the stain. This is called "popping the grain" as it allows the stain to penetrate better, because the wood, like a sponge will be more apt to absorb it.

I assume you mean AC compressor, not air compressor, unless you're driving a constuction vehicle with an air compressor for power tools or something.The "hissing" noise is probably just the vacuum switch inside the dashboard that switches vents on & off, or is controlling outside/inside air intake - perfectly normal.  I'd listen for the engine idle "dipping" breifly, or cooling fans at the condenser turning on, when you turn on the AC.  This should at least tell you if the compressor is getting power.Shops don't charge much just to look at your system and let you kjnow what's wrong with it, then you can make an educated choice as to what to do. <SEP> how do I know whether my air compressor is broken in my car?

If the cables have gone bad, they will have wrapped up around the drive spool, kinked, etc. Your only option there is to replace them. The part you need for that is called the "window lift regulator". Dorman makes aftermarket regulators that may fit your car. The motors also have a gear drive and the "dogs" sometimes strip out. I repair those by removing the motor, removing the plate over the drive head (one screw) clean out, and use 3 nylon nuts (solid nylon, not "nyloc") as the driv dogs.Here is how to on these types.Remove door panel and inner moisture barrier.Unplug motor connection and remove the three screws which hold motor in place, These may be "Torx" headed. Remove the motor from the door.To remove glass, you will need to do some drilling. Put window glass in a position where you can see the two rivets holding it to the regulator slide. Carefully use a punch to knock out the pin in each rivet, then drill rvet heat out. Remove the glass and lay aside (carefully of course). You will have to twist window, but it will come out. be sure to remove the inner "wiping" seal on the top of the door.Now all you have left is the regulator. It is held by two studs/nuts at the top, and two rivets ant the bottom which must also be punched, and drilled out.Reassembly is the reverse of removal. Instead of riveting back in place, I use 1/4" blots, nuts, and lockwashers. On the glass, use bolts and Nyloc nuts, ore a plain nut held with epoxy on the threads. The white insulators snap together in the galss. The bolt goes through them. JUST SNUG UP THIS BOLT/NUT COMBO DO NOT OVERTIGHTEN!!!!!Ford dealer in my area quoted 435 bucks to repair one window on a Grand Marquis.

chances are if you drilled into a pipe, you'd know it immediately. If you're hanging shelves don't you want to mount them to studs? There are a few things to consider: where your hot water heater is, whether or not your house is multi-story, where on the wall you want to drill. Most reputable plumbers, electricians etc use nail plates, a metal protective plate that fits over where pipe or wire passes through a stud to prevent drywallers or subsequent homeowners from damaging their installations. But for future reference, figure that piping will most always run in the most logical route, from where it enters your house to the furthest outlet. Kitchens, bathrooms etc will usually be designed where they share a common wall. In your case, just because there's a bathroom behind the wall you wish to mount your shelves on doesn't mean the piping is within that wall.  Most times, you'll find the shower/bath, sinks and toilet share a common wall, this is because its simpler to run the piping thus saving costs. If the wall you're drilling into is the same wall your bathroom fixtures are on and/or you have 2  or more stories then use a little care..If they're not then don't worry. Homebuilders take into account this ocurrence and take measures to prevent it. Relax. <SEP> how do i drill a hole in my wall without hitting any water pipes? I just drilled a few holes in a bedroom wall to mount a couple of small shelves.  I used a stud finder and found two areas to drill into to put the supports for the shelves.  I realized afterwards that I was drilling into a wall that has a bathroom on the other side.  I'm paranoid that I might have drilled through the pipe.  There's no sign that anything happened (the drill bit wasn't wet or anything), but I'm still worried.Any tips on 1) figuring out whether I did any damage and 2) preventing me from making a similar mistake in the future?
I am a Construction Superintendent and I'm here too help.  First I want to say that there is no such thing as a perfectly built home.  If there was, you couldn't afford it.  With that said, you need to send a punchlist, in writing, certified mail to your builder.  Give the builder a reasonable amount of time to make the repairs.  More than likely, the builder used a Masonry sub-contractor.  Try to find out who that is.If the builder and/or the contractor do not address your issues in reasonable time then you simply go to your town hall and look for the Code Official or Construction Office.  I have seen firsthand, almost immediate results when the Code Officials get involved.  They know all of the builders and they should be able to help out.Most builders allow one year for punchlist items, settling cracks and the like.  Give this a try. <SEP> How do I get the builder to fix problems in my new home that they promised to fix?

The best way to make stucco look smooth (level?)is to spray it with something called a "hopper gun" which can be purchased usually in the paint dept. of any national hardware store such as Home Depot. Even with a hopper gun it is difficult... and if you have no experience I suggest practicing until you can get the look you desire. The instructions that come with the gun will help you get started but there is nothing like experience. There is infomation on the container of most stucco products that tell you how much water you can add to the material - water makes the product spray easier but slows drying time. While it is possible to spread stucco and get a smooth surface - this would take far more practice. If you want to check out the product I just put on the front of my own home (Tuff 2) here's the URL:http://www.styro.net/FoundationandICFCoatings.html.htmlI don't sell, own, or have any interest in this company but I can tell you from my experience they are extremely customer friendly--AND they have short videos of the application of stucco you can watch (if you have access to high speed internet) Hope this helps.....Jeff <SEP> how do you get stucco level on a wall??

Abrasive action of some sort. You'll have to find out what works for you.Also, I assume you don't mean big pieces of concrete, but something smaller like dripping or splash from another project. Big pieces will need to be broken apart and manually moved out. You can rent an electric or pneumatic jack hammer, or use a sledge hammer.Very high pressure power washers (rental) can cut concrete.An angle grinder with various disks can scrape it away. For the lightest splash, a wire wheel in the angle grinder should work.Use goggles, leather work gloves and all recommended safety equipment when doing this. Whatever method you use, there'll be lots of schmutz flying through the air. <SEP> How do I remove cement from my stone patio without chemicals? USING ONLY ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY PRODUCTS

You need to list what part of the emission test is not passing. Is it excessive CO? Excessive NOx? Or excessive Hydrocarbons? Each has a different reason for causing the failure.Excessive CO means you're lacking oxygen for complete combustion. Check the air cleaner and air intake.Excessive Hydrocarbons means too much fuel or poor combustion. Check Fuel injectors to be sure they aren't sticking, Spark plugs.Excessive NOx means combustion is too hot. You've got various ways to reduce NOx emissions. Typically a variable valve systems will automatically minimize NOx emissions which I believe the CRX has.

Here's what I do. Unscrew the shower head. Take out the washer that's designed to conserve water. It's usually white. You'll know it when you see it. There's a tiny hole for the water to go through. Take that out, put some teflon tape around the threads of the pipe cause that washer wont be making a seal anymore. Works every time.When I stay in hotels. I take tools with me. One to fix the shower. Some to unlock the windows they don't want you to open. =).You can also turn up the pressure to the building. Just look for where the water enters the house. See if there's a pressure regulator there. Here's how it works. The more you turn the bolt clockwise. The more pressure you'll get. But don't over do it because that regulator's there for a reason. Not all houses have them. Where I live it's a city ordinance that you must have one.. <SEP> How can i make my shower have more oomph?

Cut out (at a bevel) a rectangular piece of drywall at least an inch larger that the hole you're patching. Using the patch as a template, place it over the hole and trace. Cut out using the tracing as your guide at the same bevel as the patch. Insert a backer board with construction adhesive applied to the ends. Hold the backer board firmly in place and screw drywall screws through the drywall into the board, at least 1 inch away from the edge of the hole. Repeat if using two backer boards. Place the new piece of drywall in the hole and fasten it to the backer board(s) with screws. Smooth compound around the edges of the patch on the wall. Smooth it out and put drywall tape over all joints with the joint knife. At the end of each joint, press the edge of the knife blade in firmly and use as a straightedge to tear off the tape. Sand when dry.Using a wide joint knife, spread a smooth, thin layer of joint compound over the repaired area or over all joints of the new patch. Be sure to extend beyond the damaged part and feather the edges out to the surrounding wall. Wait at least 24 hours. The compound should be dry before you sand it. Use a fine- grade drywall sandpaper on a sanding block. Wear a dust mask when sanding. You may have to repeat both these steps to achieve the desired results. <SEP> how can I fix ahole in my kitchen ceiling (about the size of a tea plate) without renewing the entire ceiling? it happened when I noticed a leak from the ceiling which was located to the bath (the seal had deteriorated) this has now been fixed and it no longer leaks.

I agree. Almost every widow unit made doesn't have any refrigerant taps to add refrigerant. Most causes of window units not working are usually dirty coils. Take the window unit out and take it apart and clean the condenser (outside) coil and the evaporator (inside) coil with a garden hose and sprayer. Wash the coils out the opposite way the airflow goes through the coil. Let it dry out good and also clean and/or replace the filter. Put the unit back in the widow and try it. 9 times out of 10 that usually fixes it. Dirty coils make the compressor and motor works  lot harder, and therefore they get hotter the harder they work. This can lead to burnt connections on the compressor, or burnt windings on the motors. If a motor or compressor is bad, it is far cheaper to replace the whole unit than to repair. Walmart usually has cheap prices on A/C's this time of year. Good luck! <SEP> How do you recharge a window air conditionors freon?

Having never owned one myself I cannot speak from experience. However I have seen many Subaru vehicles and consider them to be very sound in all aspects.

First answer was a good one. Pack all entry holes with steel wool IF you cannot properly repair the holes. A tin can lid works well also. Mice don't like metal.It sounds as if Momma was already there inside somewhere and gave birth. 8 in 3 days suggests a new and hungry family or an infestation which will only grow. Do you have an attic? If so, bait it with traps. Small chunks of Snickers works great as bait on the trap. Put traps all over attic for three days, clean them, leave them out for 3-5 days and reset them for another 3 days. Do this until all mice are gone. If you have a crawl space under your house use the same routine. as for the attic.Check everything outside that is near and/or touching your house - even tree/bush limbs. Mice can climb anything - amazing little creatures - so look at all possibilities.If you cannot stand to use traps and clean up the aftermath then there are some great dehydration poisons on the market. Dehydration works from the inside out. Ingested, mice usually search for water, thus leaving their den. Reaction however drys them out leaving just the dry remains intact and easy to dispose of. Place these small packets strategically. <SEP> How can I find out house mice are getting into the house? Live in the country but 8 in three days is too many! It's a darn good thing skunks haven't decided to live with me! The mice need a winter place, but there seems to be a direct conduit to the same built-in cupboard. If I nail a can lid oven what may be their door into the cupboard, won't they just chew another door? I have searched and cannot locate their entrance from outside.
If the battery, starter and starter circuit are working correctly, and the starter isn't able to turn the engine - it's possible that the engine is seized.To check without using the starter: remove the spark plugs.

Too many variables such as what model, what engine, does it have a/c or not. Please, I advise people, if they don't know what they are doing, don't. Then again, i often get cars that people tried to fix themselves and screwed it up worse and they end up towing it to me. Guess what?

Yea a mix of sand and cement will do it.  You can aide in curing it out by placing a wet paper towel on the patch and taping it down then putting some plastic kitchen wrap over that and taping it down.

You may have two problems by the sound of it. First you need to check the seat safety switch because it sounds as if that isn't making contact with the bottom of the seat. When you try to shift it into gear the safety shuts the mower down because the safety thinks nobody is sitting on the mower. It's less likely that the linkage for the shifter is broken or just loose. While your under there take a look for a small box looking thing that should be placed by the NEUTRAL setting. The box is a safety device to make you place the transmission in neutral before you can start the mower. Sometimes you can unplug it and the mower will start but if it's a newer mower than it may be loose and just needs to be tightened up. If you find either one of those to be the problem, than go to your nearest auto parts store and get a tube of LOCK-TIGHT and coat the threads before you tighten everything up. I'll bet you find a loose seat safety switch. <SEP> How to fix a riding lawn mower if it cuts off when it is put in gear and sometimes it won't even go in gear.

Hi, follow these instructions to the letter. If you are not too sure, take it to a garage.1/ Check the voltage across your battery with the ignition off.

NO!Dear god no, use gas! If you don't use gas you'll break it if the seal is very old and solid. Believe me I know here, I deal in irreplaceable glass all of the time. If I were to break it, there is no going to the glass shop and getting another!The sealer is a rubber, and rubber breaks down with petrol. It takes some time, maybe even a whole day if it's totally solid, but man it helps, helps a lot. Makes the sealer gooey again. Just get a squirt bottle and keep squirting the seals with fuel and keep it wet for as long as possible. You can feel with your fingernail that it's starting to get softer. Best thing about it is, it has zero effect on the inner safety lining of the glass.

The A/C compressor is going to have to come off to make this really easy.  Once it is off, there should be a bolt in the center of the pulley assembly that will have to be removed.  Afterwards, you will need a "pulley puller", and some penetrating oil (WD40 works good).  It's a pretty straightforward operation, however I would def. make sure you have no refrigerant left in the system before taking the compressor off (though if the compressor is really easy to get to, you may not need to take it off of the vehicle).  Also, to get the best performance out of the a/c system, make sure you take it to a shop that will put a vaccuum on it before adding new refrigerant. <SEP> how do you fix a ac clutch in a 95 ford exploer?

Had the same problem this spring. The bolts that you are probably referring to is in the powerhead unit. These are not your ordinary drill out type of bolts and then use an easy out like everyone here is recomending to you. Outboard motors are a unique repair due to the useage of them in SALT water with the corrosion in the head around the bolts. These cannot be removed by yourself. they must be taken to a machine shop to have them removed professionally. This is not an easy task or is it a cheap repair. These bolts alone are made for outbord motors and must be replaced with the same type of outboard replacement parts. The cost for labor and parts can run you several hunded dollars or maybe even over $1000. Best bet is to take it to a repair shop that does this every day, probably at a marina.  I dont know your model or size of this outboard but after you get this estimate , carefully decide weather the cost of the repair is worth the repair. Consider how many hours you have on this outboard. If your estimate runs into the thousand dollar or higher, and you have a lot of hours on the engine, then you may be more apt to buy a new outboard engine. I went this route about a month ago and decided that my $2200 estimate and 500 hours on my engine was not worth it. i bought a new outboard in another state and towed it home. I put my outboard for sale on E-Bay and sold it at a decent price to offset my new outboard price.Good Luck and think before you repair. <SEP> How do you remove broken bolts? I have 2 broken bolts in a housing on my outboard motor that I can't get out.
There should be a a "spring loaded" tension pulley on it somewhere. Follow the path of the belt until you find it. Once you locate it you should be able to put a socket or wrench on the pulley and pull it (not turn it) as you do you should see the tension on the belt release. Once it is loose enough slip the old belt off. The precess i the same to put it on except you need to have the new belt correctly around all the other pulleys and when you pull on the tension pulley it helps to have someone slip the belt on for you.Note: It will take a lot more pull to get the new belt on then it did to get the old one off.

Scratches are difficult to remove. Most kitchen appliances, sinks, and counters have a polished finish with short directional polishing lines. Restoring a polished finish to its original appearance requires a professional such as a company that specializes in fabricating or polishing stainless steel. If the refrigerator or dishwasher door panel is replaceable, purchasing a new panel is normally more cost effective than professional refinishing. The homeowner may want to consider obtaining replacement panels with angel hair, distressed, swirl, or embossed finish. These finishes help to hide light scratching and can be obtained from companies that specialize in stainless steel finishes.Counters and appliance doors that are not easily removable must be refinished in place. When the counter is refinished, it may have long rather than short polishing lines. If a slightly different finish is acceptable and cost is a consideration, a homeowner can refinish the counter or appliance using a non-metallic abrasive pad such as a Scotch Brite® pad. This can be done by rubbing the surface with the pad using long uniform strokes in the same direction as the current polishing lines. This will not eliminate deep scratches. A professional may offer this finish as a less expensive option. The resulting finish is normally referred to as a hairline or long grain finish. Some appliance companies are starting to offer this finish. <SEP> How do you remove scratches from stainless steel refrigerator doors?

My personal favorite lately has been When2meet .  Time selection is easily clickable/draggable, reporting is intuitive and visual, and there's minimal setup involved (read: practically none).  There is no contact list integration, but you can send the short, private link directly to your recipients.  And, of course, it's free!  The only criterion listed above which I'd say it falls a bit short on is the ability for the organizer to specify time intervals that are "on the table".  You can specify a list of dates, and a range of times on those dates, but that range must be contiguous and the same across dates.  In effect, the organizer doesn't get special priority in limiting the choices.  Although it wasn't one of your criteria, it also lacks time zone support, so it's really only good for face-to-face or highly localized meetings. <SEP> What is a good webapp for finding the best meeting time for a group of people?

CLOSE, NOT ONLY DO YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THE # 1 PISTON IS AT TOP DEAD CENTER (TDC).  YOU ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE IT IS ON THE COMPRESSION STROKE.  IF YOU PUT THE DISTRIBUTER BACK IN POINTING SO IT IS SET TO FIRE THE # 1 CYLINDER, AND THE PISTON IS AT TDC EXHAUST STROKE, YOU WILL BE 180 DEGREES OFF ON THE TIMING.

YOU WILL FEEL AIR BLOWING OUT A LOT HARDER ON THE COMPRESSION STOKE THEN ON THE EXHAUST STROKE BECAUSE THE VALVES ARE CLOSED ON THE COMPRESSION STROKE, BUT THE EXHAUST VALVE IS OPEN ON THE EXHAUST STROKE SO MOST THE AIR GOES OUT THERE.  ONCE YOU HAVE FOUND THE COMPRESSION STROKE, IF YOU STILL HAVE A TIMING MARK ON THE BALANCER YOU CAN USE IT TO FIND TDC.  JUST ROTATE THE ENGINE UNTILL THE MARK LINES UP WITH THE 0 ON THE TAB.

There are a few ways to infate your suspension. First why is it low and where? In front or back or both? Oh sorry, you said fronts only, Are both low, if so your bags are leaking more then likely.Did you raise the vehicle without turning off the suspension switch in the trunk ? Or did they deflate themselves? Usually when they deflate themselves, you have a leaking airbag or line, or even a bad pump, but you said the rears inflate right? So then the pump is probably ok. You can inflate the airbag system automatically by running the engine for a while, BUT, If you have a source leak like a blown airbag, they might not re-inflate. Or use the NGS, WDS, Snap-On scanner or OTC for that fact to turn the pump on and open the air switches at the air bags. Older Lincolns had a air inflate valve on or near the pump. It looks like a tire valve stem. I not sure but I do not think that the Mark VII's have one. Do you hear the air pump running? when you turn on the Key? You can try and put a floor jack under the vehicle on the side that is low, Jack it up alittle bit, then turn the car on for a little while. This might help to raise it by themselves. Listem carefully near the air bags for an air leak. Use a soapy spray solution like your dishwashing soap mixed with water in a squirt bottle and spary the bags down and look for bubbles.

Look for a radiator drain spigot usually on the bottom driver's side of the radiator. Once the engine has cooled, take the radiator cap off and open the drain spigot. About 1-2 gallons drain out into your drain pan which you store in a used plastic container for toxic substance disposal at your local land fill facility. Now close the drain spigot and fill the radiator with distilled water. Put the radiator cap back on and drive the car for at least 30 minutes with the heater on full. Repeat the same procedure after the engine has cooled, driving the car again for another 30 minutes or so. The idea is to dilute the antifreeze concentration in the coolant system to the point that it's mostly distilled water. Finally, empty the radiator one last time and fill it with a 100% concentration of antifreeze. That will give you a 50/50 concentration of new antifreeze since about half of the coolant system capacity is in the radiator and half is in the engine and heater core etc. Run the engine at idle until the thermostat opens and all air is bled out the radiator cap opening. Keep topping off the radiator to keep it full. Put the radiator cap back on and the job is done. You can flush the overflow coolant tank with a garden hose. <SEP> how do I change the coolant on a 1995 Ford windstar?

Right click on a point and select "What's Here?" to create a marker, but it will be to the closest thing (business, intersection, address, etc). This essentially performs a search with the latitude and longitude and returns whatever is closest to your search. A URL to do that would be:  http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.128061,-106.535561&ll=35.126517,-106.535131&z=17  With the q (for query I believe) being the coordinates where you want your marker.

A reconditioned engine will go through several steps and processes before it is reassembled. Depending on the type of shop doing the work, and the type of engine the rebuild process could be simple or complex. Most shops disassemble the engine, hot tank the main components like the cylinder block, head(s), and related. Next, all clearances are checked to ensure that they are within factory specification. Cylinders may be bored, but most of the time they only require being honed and ridge reamed.If the crankshaft is out of spec. it will be reground. Meaning the rod and main journals will be ground down to make concentric again. The crank and rod main bearings will be replaced with the corisponding under sizes. The pistons will most likely be reused, and fitted with new rings.camshaft(s) and lifters are inspected and reused or replaced. Oil pumps are replaced. All freeze plugs and gaskets are replaced. Water pumps are replaced, as are timing gears and chains or belts.Cylinder heads are checked, and all valves are removed and checked. The out of spec vavles will be reground or replaced. Valve guides are checked, and replaced if worn. Valve stem seals are replaced.Things like intake and exhaust manifolds, oil pan, valve covers, timing covers, front covers, etc. are cleaned and reused.Most reman shops will paint the completed assembly.There are other engine specific things I didn't mention, but this is a general primer on what is done to an engine.Of course this is on the shop level, backyard mechanics, and wannabe diy'ers will do it differently. <SEP> how does reconditioning an automobile engine work? what are the jargons and parameters associated with engine reconditioning involved

Phone wires are easy to check. If you have one line it is usually hooked up to the Red and Green Wires. If you have two lines, then line two is almost always on Black and Yellow. Know where all the wires come into the house.Check the non working jack that is closest to where the wires come into the house First. One wire off can knock out all the jacks after it.Make sure the wire is exactly on the one screw it is supposed to be on and does not have a chance to tough any other wire or screw.Be systematic moving from one jack to the next. It could be in the jack, or in the wire. Just because a wire does not look broken, does not mean that the wire is not broken.If this does not work, you should go to last Working Jack or jacks which are nearest the first one not working. Check that all the wires are hooked up there properly. This is not rocket science. You can do this yourself. If you can not get the phone tester, you can use the cheapest wired phone you have and plug it in as you move from jack to jack instead.Good Luck <SEP> How do I trace back phone wires to see where the disconnect is? The phone jack in the bedroom stopped working, and I dont believe it is the wiring to the jack itself, or the phone, that is not working.

To replace the wheel cylinder remove the return spring from one shoe so that pressure is released off of the cylinder. Remove the brake line and the usually two bolts that hold the cylinder to the backing plate. Bolt on the new one, reconnect the line and reattach the spring and bleed the brakes.

There is a problem with the microswitches on the Ford Taurus / Mercury Sable - I replaced them on a customer car at my shop a couple of months ago. The part number for the Door Jamb Switches from the Ford Dealer is SW-5528.  List is somewhere around $15 each I think, and it takes about 30 minutes per door to fix.  The trick is figuring out which door needs the switch - some sources recommend replacing them all, but if you open up the door and unplug the switch (it is actually in the door latch mechanism so you have to remove the inside door trim) the light will go out - try it on each door until you figure out which one is bad. <SEP> how do you get the interior lights to shut off on a 99 mercury sable?
The most common reason to replace tires is insufficient tread depth. The grooves in the tire channel water away to prevent hydroplaning, which results in a loss of traction. When a tire has less than 3/32" tread depth, it's ability to channel the water is diminished and it's time to replace it. A rule of thumb is to stick a penny in the tread with the top of Lincoln's head parallel to the surface of the tire. If any part of his head is exposed, the tire should be replaced. Most tires also have tread wear indicators that show as bars across the tire when there's insuffucuent tread.Anytime a tire has small cracks in the sidewall, or is mis-shapen in any way, it should be replaced. <SEP> how to know when to change tires?

Very good description! When there is only one cable in the switch box with a red wire then the black is hot and red is the switch leg(called one-upping) and white is the common/neutral. Hook the black and red to the switch and nut the whites together and close up. In the ceiling box The black wire feeds the switch so you tie it to a hot circuit(should already be done but will usually be black) and the red you tie to the hots of the ceiling fan black and blue and white to white and green to green. This is if there is only one switch in the wall! If there are two switches then its a little different. What has happened here with a single switch is that the fan allows for two but aren't necessary. The black wire is usually for the fan motor and the blue(slightly smaller) is for the lights(if there are no lights then don't wire the blue it's there for later light expansion.) <SEP> how do I connect a ceiling fan/light when the power feed is at the ceiling box? There is only one cable at the wall switch which is black, red, white, and bare that runs up to the ceiling box. The ceilng box also has a junction of wall outlets wired together. How do I wire in my ceiling fan/light which has (4 wires) black, white, blue, and green.

You are dealing with a compression faucet. The valve opens and closes via a valve stem. That stem has splines on the end of it, underneath the handle. The handle has ridges in the backside hole that mate with the splines. If the handle is spinning around on the valve stem, what has happened is that the splines and or ridges have worn and do not mate properly. Since the usual reason that you cannot remove a handle after removing the screw beneath the index cap is corrosion between the mating surfaces of splines and ridges, I doubt this is your problem since the knob is spinning around the valve stem. Look on the side of the handle for some sort of set screw. These are fairly small and usually require an allen wrench to remove them. If there is none, try prying the knob off with a large flathead screwdriver under the handle. Place something such as a paint stir stick between screwdriver and any surface that may become damaged. If that doesn't work you could purchase a faucet handle puller for the job.Once you have the handle removed most likely you'll need to replace the valve stem. You will need to turn off the water to the valve. If the shower does not have shut offs somewhere nearby ( most likely it won't) and you are wanting to remove the hot water valve stem, you should be able to shut off the cold water supply to the hot water heater to avoid having to use the shut off for the entire house. By turning off the cold water supply located on the line coming into the hot water heater, you are in effect shutting off pressure to all hot water faucets in the house. Then untighten the packing nut that holds the valve stem in place. You should now be able to continue backing out the valve stem until it comes out of the seat. Take this to a hardware store and replace. Why did all this happen in the first place? The screw under the index cap became loose and allowed the handle to start grinding the splines off. Hope the info helps. <SEP> how to remove old shower knobs? I have an old house built in the 40's and the hot knob just spins and spins and won't completely turn off the water any more.

An oil fired boiler doesn't have a pilot flame like a gas boiler does. It fires up automatically when the thermostat calls for heat just like a gas boiler. If the burner flame fails to ignite after about a 30 second timeout period at start up, the burner motor shuts down because you don't want to be spraying oil into the combustion chamber if the flame's not lit. The red button can be pushed once (and only once) to try to restart the burner if it times out after trying to start automatically as it normally does. But usually it won't start and just ends up spraying more oil into the combustion chamber. This is a dangerous condition for the oil repairman because once he fixes the original problem which caused the timeout and failure of the burner to light, the burner may start explosively due to all the excess oil in the combustion chamber. So don't press the red button more than once, and don't hold the red button in. When the repairman arrives, tell him how many times you pressed the red button so he'll know what safety measures to take to restart the burner once it's repaired. <SEP> how do I start a Boiler?

There are two typical non-utility sources:1. the ground around your house does not shed water away from the foundation.2. the groundwater table is high.I have found that most instances the problem is the first one.  Usually the least expensive method to be re-grading the yard to keep water away from the house.  Occasionally you may need to excavate to the foundation slab, and apply a good waterproofing such as an asphalt compound. Customarily, home builders throw trash, such as lunch litter and wood scraps, along the foundation walls before the backfill is placed.  In addition to natural settlement of the ground around a home, when the trash decays, or collapses, the ground settles further.  When gutters overflow, this area holds water which can easily get inside unless the walls were waterproofed to swimmingpool standards.I recommend pulling back the top 4-6" of soil from around the house by as much as 6 - 8 feet out.  Get some clay soil and place a wedge of it with the thickest part near the house. Pack the clay down good. Then re-grade the top soil back, and plant. the end result will be that the ground around the foundation is higher than the remainder of the yard.  It will also be important to have the yard graded to get positive drainage moving the rainwater further away. A Landscape Architect can help you with this.  Then be sure to get the down-spouts pointed away from the house. <SEP> how do i stop water from seeping into my basement?

For a good starting point try:-Lead came and copper foil glassworkFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaJump to: navigation, searchThis article is on the techniques of lead-came and copper-foil glasswork. For a general overview of stained glass art, see stained glass. A typical copper-foil Tiffany lamp, with a dragonfly designLead-came and Copper-foil glasswork are the arts and crafts of cutting colored glass and joining the pieces into picturesque designs.The traditional method uses lead came. This is the method used for centuries in Europe, mainly in Religious buildings such as cathedrals, churches and monasteries, and also in aristocratic houses.An alternative method, replacing the lead came with copper foil, was invented in the 19th century, enabling creation of three-dimensional works, in addition to two dimensional ones to which the lead-came method is limited. The copper-foil artwork is commonly called Tiffany stained glass, even though there is a debate about whether John La Farge or Louis Comfort Tiffany invented this alternative to lead-came glasswork.Contents [hide]1 Overview 2 The process details 2.1 Designing on paper 2.2 Transferring the design to the glass 2.3 Cutting the glass 2.4 Grinding down the cut glass 3 Lead came 3.1 Stretching and cutting the lead-came strips 3.2 Assembling the lead and glass 3.3 Soldering the lead joints 3.4 Cementing the lead and glass panel 3.5 Adding reinforcement bars 4 Copper foiling 5 Tools and materials 5.1 General 5.2 For lead-came work 5.3 For copper-foil work 6 Other uses of the copper-foil technique 7 See also 8 External links  [edit]OverviewIn both lead-came and copper-foil glasswork a colorful design is created by the artist who joins pieces of stained glass panes that have been specially cut for the work.In the lead-came method the pieces of glass are embedded into the channels of the came, and then the joints between the came strips are soldered together.In the copper-foild method, the edges of the glass pieces are wrapped with copper adhesive tape, then soldered together along the whole length of the copper strip.[edit]The process details The steps in creation of Lead Came and Copper Foil Glasswork[edit]Designing on paperThe first step for both techniques is to create a design on paper. You can create your own designs, or use the large selection of design books and software available.The next step is to transfer the design to a piece of paper from which paper templates are cut out. Special pattern scissors are used, that cut out an extra thin strip of paper between the pieces, to compensate for the width of the lead-came or the copper-foil, that separates the pieces of glass in the final work. The scissors for lead-came work leave out a wider strip than for copper-foil.[edit]Transferring the design to the glassThere are two schools for this step: one practices gluing the cut paper to the glass before cutting it, the other holds the cut paper to the glass, and uses a paint pen to mark the glass around the paper edges. In a high output glass studio, professionals simply hold the pattern piece tight to the glass and carefully follow the edge of the paper with the cutter head. This can only be done well with practice.[edit]Cutting the glassIn this step the glass is scored using cutting oil and a steel or carbide wheel, making a tiny imperfection along which the glass is broken using glass plyers - when pressure is applied to the glass with the plyers, the glass snaps at the score line.[edit]Grinding down the cut glassThe glass pieces obtained from the previous step have sharp edges, and are not 100% accurate in their shape. The glazier can either account for this inaccuracy while glazing with lead came or implement an electric glass grinder with a diamond-coated grinding wheel to smooth-off the glass pieces, and to give them their accurate shape.
