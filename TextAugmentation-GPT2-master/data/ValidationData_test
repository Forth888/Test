I figured out a way to do this for Mac users using Mac Mail and address book without needing to download extra software. This works with Mac Mail 4.6 and Address Book 5.0.3. Not sure if it works for other vers or not. This may work similarly for other IMAP Email programs like Thunderbird, but I can't vouch for that.  Here are the steps:   Set up your Gmail account in Mac Mail. Make sure the incoming mail server is "imap.gmail.com" You can find this under the toolbar>Mail>Preferences>Accounts.  In Gmail, create a Label for the emails for which you want to extract email addresses.  In Gmail, label all the emails you want per Label above.  In Gmail, go to Settings>Labels and tick off the the box for the new Label you created that says "Show in IMAP."  Restart Mac Mail so the new Gmail Label syncs.  Open Address Book. If you use Address Book for your contacts you'll need to back up your contacts because you need to delete all contacts in Address Book. I believe you can do this with File>Export>Address Book Archive. I don't use Address Book other than for exporting Gmail emails so I can't give good advice on this. Delete Address Book contacts at your own risk.  In Address Book, delete all your contacts. You should be able to do this by selecting one contact, pressing Command+a and pressing the delete key.  In Mac Mail, find your IMAP folder. There should be a column on the left side of the window with all your Mailboxes. If not go to the top toolbar, select View>Show Mailboxes or press Command+Shift+M. The IMAP folder will be toward the bottom of the column below "Reminders", "RSS", "On My Mac" etc. You should see the Name of your Gmail account you set up earlier with a dropdown arrow on the left.  In Mac Mail, click the dropdown arrow next to your mailbox. This will show you a list of folders and should show the Label you created in Gmail as a folder. Select this folder by clicking it.  In Mac Mail in the Messages window )which should now display all your emails for you Gmail Label), select all the emails in the list. Go to the top toolbar, select Messages>Add Senders to Address Book or press Shift+Command+Y. All the senders for your Gmail Label should now be in Address Book.  In Address Book you can now export contacts as vCards to use in whatever program you like by going to the toolbar and selecting File>Export>Export vCards. You can even import back into Google Contacts. If you need a CSV file, unfortunately you will need to import the vCards into another program (Google Contacts works) and re-export because you cannot export CSV from Mac Mail.   Hope this helps! It's a bit cumbersome, but works for me and is pretty easy after you do it a couple of times. <SEP> Get e-mail addresses from Gmail messages received
Unless your water is extremely hard, it's doubtful the shower riser in plugged. I would first make sure the faucet is opening all the way and that it's clear of rust or debris in the valve. Also, I don't know how you heat your water but thew combination of heat and hard water forms scale which usually is worse at the heat source. Though mechanical (scraping) removal is effective it usually ends up leaking somewhere. If you can isolate the system chemical flushing is desirable but not very safe or practical for a home owner. Call a plumber. <SEP> How do I clean the pipe that feeds our shower head? The shower in our main bathroom is losing presure.

you can't hotwire a car anymore as most switches make contact for numerous things when you turn the key over....If it's newer, try the dealer with proof of ownership...

My advice would be to trace the handbrake cables from your rear calipers forward, they should meet at a point close to where your hand brake is under the car or in some cases they might go into the car in which case remove any plastic surroundings from around your handbrake inside the car and it should be there. Good Luck <SEP> How do adjust the hand brake on my 1994 Clio Rsi? It has rear calipars and I have just fitted new pads on the back as the front disc seemed to be getting hot and the rear oones seemed not to be biting. the bias valve is working ok, I have been told. Now all the discs seem to get warm most of the time but the hand brake needs adjusting.
Go to a Car stereo shop.  The reason you would go there is because sound dampening is part of high end car audio systems.  The last thing you want is road noise on your expensive car audio system.There are items you can buy such as spray on material, adhesive pads, and non-adhesive fabric type material.  Dynamat is the big popular provider of sound dampening materials, but there are online places like partsexpress.com which will sell you cheaper no-name dampening material.  Just look it up in their car-audio section.You will likely find that decreasing the noise is gonna cost you a good chunk of change and a lot of work.  Usually you need to 'dampen' (add sound deadening material) the doors and floor.  You can also do the roof if that is the main source of your problem.  If you are a DIY'er it can all be done for a few hundred dollars assuming you are comfortable with disassemblign your cars interior parts.  I would let a pro do this as there is too much potential to break panels and improperly install the materials. <SEP> How can I make my car interior less noisy? I have a 2001 civic, but on highways at high speeds it is really loud inside the car.

I don't quite understand your problem.  If you want to put a shower head directly onto the pipe that comes out of the wall, you should do the following:     1)  Remove anything currently attached to the pipe and any old putty, or tape from the threads that are there.     2)  Put a new band of teflon plumbing tape on the pipe.  It should be installed in a clockwise direction.          3)  Check for a round rubber gasket that fits into the shower head and put it inside the threaded fitting on the shower head.     4)  Hand screw the shower head onto the pipe, then tighten 1/4 to 1/2 turn with a wrench, put a cloth, or tape on the chrome fixture so as not to mar the chrome where you tighten the fitting onto the pipe.     5)  Start the water running, if the connection leaks tighten the shower head fitting very gently until it stops. <SEP> how do I connect shower hose to fixed arm on the wall, or directly to a showerhead that that need an fixed arm I bought an shower head that can only be connected to an arm with the screwthread.

If you are talking about plumbing pipes you shouldn't be able to smell them because there is supposed to be a trap in all drains which keeps water in it at all times unless it hasn't been used in a long time and the water has evaporated.There is supposed to be a vent on all drains and the water in the trap makes the sewer gas and odor go up the vent instead of into the house.If you have drains that haven't been used in a while run some water in them.If this doesn't work and you have a garbage disposal then that is probably where the odor is coming from.I personally don't like them,mainly because of odor problems and they can help to clog your pipes. <SEP> how do i fix smelly pipes?

First go buy a submersible pump (sump pump) and hose to get the water out.  If you have a window in your basement you can put the hose thru the window.  Make sure to drain the water far enough away from your home so it does not just leak back down into the basement.  Next you should pull out anything that was submerged in water and discard it.  This includes carpeting, furniture, etc.  If there is drywall on the walls, you may be able to salvage most of it by cutting a line all the way around the room 12" above the waterline and reinstalling a new strip.  Once everything is cleared out, get some dryers and dehumidifiers down there and let them run for 3-4 days.  Longer if need be.  A few nice days will help too.  Open windows if you can, as moving air helps alot.  When you think its dry enough to move things back in test the slab by taping down some clear plastic (2'X2') in the middle of the concrete floor.  Leave it taped down overnight.  If there is any condensation on the inside of the plastic the next morning, you need to keep the blowers anddehumidifiers working longer.  You may rent the dehumidifiers at your local rental yards or Home Depot. Finally, you should deal with the reason your basement flooded to begin with.  Adequate rainwater leads usually help to prevent this.  You can also dig french drains around the foundation to drain away excess water before intrusion into the structure.  Type in "french drainange" on Yahoo search for more info.  Good luck, hope this has helped. <SEP> how can i restore my basement after a flood? my basement flooded and have of the thing are distroyed. how can i get all that water out. it's at least 5 inches.

Wow, how old is that system? A lot of times with these old systems the problem is that the inlet tee (they used to be concrete, molded into the tank) deteriorates causing a grease clog at that end of the tank, so it's constantly clogging up. I'd check that out before you dig up the whole line. However if you're sure the line needs replacing, dig it up just uncovering the top of the pipe for the whole length. Once that's done you can break the clay pipe in sections and take it out while maintaining the pipe bed (so you'll be sure to have the correct fall on the new pipe). If yours is a residence replace the clay pipe with 4" sch40 PVC. The stub-out at the house end will likely be cast iron in which case you'll need a flexible coupling (rubber with tightening bands) to make that connection. At the tank end extend the new pipe into the tank a few inches and install a tee. A septic tank always has to have a tee inside the tank with a length of pipe extending downward to within about 18" of the bottom of the tank. This forces any grease and solids down into the tank and keeps the layer of floating scum away from the inlet. I think it goes without saying, but I'd have the tank pumped before attempting to replace the tee. New systems require a filter on the other end of the tank to keep any solids from entering the field lines.   I don't know if I'd go to that trouble with this old system, that's a matter of personal opinion. However, I've done repairs where the field lines were full of panty liners (they don't degrade), where a filter would have saved them. Good Luck <SEP> How do you change a septic system line from ceramic  pipe to PVC pipe?

YOU CAN'T got to Wal-Mart and get what you need.  Your car is pre-1994 and has an R-12 refrigerent system.  It isn't compatible with the R-134A you can buy at the auto parts stores or Wal-Mart.  The fluid uses a different oil base that will immediately erode and kill your seals, rendering your compressor, condenser, and evaporator useless.Most shops still have access to R-12, but it's spendy because no car has been produced since 1994 that uses it.  You can convert over to R-134A, but it's not a job you'd want to tackle in your driveway, and if all the R-12 isn't evacuated properly, it can cause problems. <SEP> how do i recharge my a/c ina 92 camaro r/s?

I'd start at either the longest expanse of straight wall or the most visable (your choice), measure out the length of the tile + a 1/4 inch more than the width of the grout line, for example: 12''(tile width) + 1/4'' (grout line width) + 1/4'' (for slop, bow in the wall, etc.)=12 1/2''. Measure this out from your two corners and snap a chalk line. Find the center of the chalk line and use the 3,4,5 method of squaring the intersecting (90 degree) line. The advantage to starting with full tiles rather than starting in the middle is that you get less waste, spend less time measuring and cutting and don't end up working over tiles you've already laid. Also, unless the building is extremely old, the walls shouldn't be so out of square that it is noticable in the laid tile. If it is, use the center method stated above.The 3,4,5 method: measure 3' along the straight line from your center mark and mark it. measure down 4' from the straight line (center mark), then with second tape measure, hold the end on the 3' mark and run diagonally down to the 4' mark. When you get exactly 5' between the 3' and 4' marks, it's square. Mark it, then run a chalkline between the original center mark and the square mark and snap. You now have a perfectly square starting point.If someone can explain the 3,4,5 method more clearly, please do. I have a feeling my explanation might be a little confusing. <SEP> how do you square up a room to lay atile floor?

Bob Vila has a good guide:A standing seam metal roof can be fabricated on the jobsite in a few days--and last for the life of the homeMetal roofing's attributes are impressive. Durable and long lasting, a metal roof requires little maintenance, can be retrofitted over many existing roofing materials, is available in a wide range of colors and styles, and is fire resistant. Standing seam metal roofs, popular in areas diverse as the hot and humid South and frigid New England, have shed their industrial roots to become an architectural statement.A standing seam roof is constructed of many interlocking panels that run vertically from the roof's ridge (the top of the roof) to the eave. The interlocking seam where two panels join together is raised above the roof's flat surface, allowing water to run off without seeping between panels. <SEP> how do you install a standard seam roof?

If you have a Network Interface box, open it and make sure the connectors are plugged in.  If they're already plugged in and you still have no phone service in the house, follow the wiring into the house and look for a connector or wire junction. This will either have plug-in connectors or blade-type push-in connectors for the wires. Check to be sure that the connectors or wires are attached.One caution - if the jacks weren't professionally wired, there may be a short in one of them, causing all the jacks not to work.  You'll have to find a problem like that by the process of elimination.  Choose one jack and examine the wiring to it.  If it checks okay, disconnect all the jacks BUT that one, then test it. If it works, reconnect the other jacks one at a time until they stop working. The last one connected will be the bad one :) <SEP> How do you activate a phone jack?

There are some additives that are used in racing as fillers (octane reducers, essentially).

All propane heaters create carbon monoxide as a biproduct of the combustion process.  Carbon monoxide is deadly and can kill you, by imparing the bloods ability to absorb oxygen.

There is no explicit way of exporting your Google Chat logs through a Google provided function but there are a number of different alternative methods which seem to be available.   The first, as mentioned by Simon, is to forward them to an email address where you can download them via POP/IMAP.  You can install the "Create a Document" labs experiment for Google Mail which allows you to create a document for each chat. This could be quite laborious though and then you have to backup from Google Docs, which is another step.  There appears to be a python script here which backups Google Chat logs. However, in the comments there appears to be some issues with being temporarily locked out if you download too much at once. <SEP> How can I export my Google chat logs?

The wood that keeps water and termites from causing damage are placed in vats of chemicals and pressurized in cylinders that allow the preservative to penetrate the entire piece of wood. You can't reproduce this by applying anything to the surface. The best surface sealers are modified water born epoxy resins. They last about 5 years with proper application because they penetrate and bond to wood fibers better than oil based ones such as Thompson's. They resist mildew because they don't contain any organic oils, and are less effected by UV light. Most of your sealers won't last more than 2 years, and aren't much cheaper than the epoxies. <SEP> How can you make wood preservers?? the ones that protect wood from termites weathering etc...?

Well there are several dirrefent kinds of stoppers for tubs on the market today.The on most people have in there homes are 1's with a trip lever on the overflow plate.To fix this probelm follow below.1'st unscrew the 2 flat headed screws on the plate. Set them on the floor not in the tub they could roll down to the drain this is for safety only.2nd pull unit straight up then towards you some will come out easy some you will have to move back and forth as you pull up.3rd on the back of the overflow plat the rob with the round stopper connects to the back of the plate with a clip.remove clip you will have to bend it straight and pull out.Go to the local hardware store and buy a new Overflow plate.and reinstall pin and bend it so it wont come lose then slide unit back into overflow pipe and screw back in.The problem you are haveing is on the overflow plat on the back side is a spring when you push the lever up or down the spring holds the stopper up or down. When the spring loses it strength it will not hold itself. NOTE= When you buy the new unit if it does not hold water 100% remove uniut and adjust the nut on the rod this will either raise or lower the stopper to the correct height.This info is if you have this unit installed on your tub.If this is not the unit you have on your tub and are still haveing this problem please feel free to contact me for the info on how to fix it.E-Mail me at   kos101@yahoo.comWhen sending your e-mail please describe what kind of unit you have.GoodLuck. <SEP> how do i fix a bath tub drain that will not stay open?

You dont need an air conditioner for the attic. If you go to HD or Lowes you can get an attic fan which costs $90 and would be much cheaper to run.  Putting an air conditioner in the attic would cause problems any way. Central air does not get directed into the attic, just the house, so that wont help your situation. Also dont forget if you air condition the attic then you are looking at some major moisture problems in the summer which is probably what you are trying to avoid. This in turn would warp the flooring and possibly ceiling below. Also it would cause mold problems from drastic temperature change. <SEP> How to cool attic -in cape code home-we have two rooms and no central airconditioning?

Remove the caliper then the caliper bracket. The rotor should com off easily. You may need to "whop it" with a hammer to unstick the dirt and rust. If you are attempting to get at the wheel bearings, the rotor needs to come off, the axle nut needs to be removed and the tie ro and ball joint needs to be removed and then the bolts holing the knuckle to the strut. Bearings can be pressed out and back in, or the whole unit can be replaced. Wheel alignment then MUST be done. <SEP> How can I remove a brake disc from the steering knuckle on a 87 Mazda 626?

To bleed the clutch system on a toyo pickup is pretty easy. First thing you should do is suck all the old fluid out of the clutch master cylinder with a suction bulb. That way it doesnt have to leak slowly through the lines. Then fill the clutch master cylinder up completely with DOT 3 brake fluid. That is what Toyota uses. Go underneath the truck on the right hand side, look at where the engine joins to the tranny. The bellhousing as it is called, has a clutch slave cylinder mounted on it. It is a round cylinder with a rod coming out one end, and what appears to be a brake line attaching to the other end. Look closely on the end with the line, and you will find the bleeder screw. It is a 10mm. Use a 6 point wrench if you have it, if not, a good quality 12 point. You dont want to round the flats on the bleeder. It works like a brake caliper bleeder. Just loosen it a couple of rounds, and let the fluid start to drain out. If there is air in the system, it may take a minute to sart draining. Use a bucket to catch the fluid, and let it drain until the fluid coming out is clear and not bubbly. Make sure you keep an eye on the master cylinder up top as it is pretty small and will run out of fluid quickly. When the fluid is clear and not bubbly, retighten the bleeder screw, fill the master cylinder reservoir, and you are almost done. Some air tends to remain in the system inside the master cylinder, but if it does, you can remedy it easily. Just get in the vehicle, and start pumping the clutch. ALL the way to the floor, and ALL the way back up. It may take a while to work the air out, so if you have bad knees, find someone who needs to use a stairstepper. When the pedal feels nice and crisp, and your clutch starts disengaging around the middle of the pedal travel, check the fluid again, and you are done. Pretty easy. <SEP> how do i bleed the clutch on a toyota truck?

All machines are different, but this first part is always the same, you want to unplug the machine, remove the needle and any bobbins of thread.  Then check your owner's manual for specific oiling points and the correct screws you may need to remove to grant you access.  To insure that after oiling it just does'nt wind up creating alot of gunk instead of a smooth working part you'll need to clean the areas of lint and dust. Make sure you use just one or two drops of a light machine oil (like 3in1 oil) per oiling point.   Good Luck! <SEP> How do i oil a sewing machine?
I would check the "Coolant Level Sensor" first if the cooling system is full of anti-freeze and it is not overheating or showing any signs of leaking!

I have a 1992 Chevy Lumina. The low coolant light came on about a week ago and has not went off. I checked the coolant, and it's full.

My car doesn't overheat, but I'm afraid that the motor is going to get damaged if I can't get the low coolant light to go off.
There are two kinds of meters.For the old-fashioned (but still widely used) dial meter, you read the numbers from left to right.

This new answer works if one of the other recipients has a top level domain that is common-ish and different from yours.  Aaron's answer appears not to work, for two reasons.  The first is that google does not implement wild cards in gmail ( Wildcard search in Gmail ). The second reason is that, from experience, I find the search considers BOTH conjuncts, to:me and, say, -to:com .  It's easy to check by entering to:me -to:com in the search bar, and finding that nothing sent to your gmail.com address is there.  From the question I linked above we know that you need to search tokens; e.g., top level domains like .com and .org. But we know we can't just do  to:me to:(-com -org -edu -gov -uk -net -ca -de -jp -fr -au -us -ru -ch -it -nl -se -no -es -mil)  As an aside, don't try and putting ALL top level domains in, as the search will be rejected for length.  I got the above list from This blog post about common TLDs .  There is one more thing to deal with, and that is the empty to: field.  My work around is to use is:important to limit the intrusion of these.  Gmail complained when I tried to make a filter with this flag, but it did properly filter a new (important) email to me.  So, we come to my answer, where my own top level domains are .com and .uk (.ac.uk, but the .uk is a token in itself):  is:important to:((-com OR me) -coop -org -edu -gov (-uk OR me) -net -ca -de -jp -fr -au -us -ru -ch -it -nl -se -no -es -mil)  This enforces the following two properties:  1. Emails to anyone with a listed domain different from yours are rejected  2. If an email has one of your domains, it must be (at least) to you.  In a similar manner, you can add specific email addresses that you commonly receive email together with you by adding something like -<coworker@yourdomain.com> <SEP> How can I set a Gmail filter that finds email sent “only to me”?

Timing on this engine is not adjustable. The computer automatically determines the correct timing for the engine based on inputs from various sensors (i.e. crank position, cam position).

The specific location will vary from car to car, and I do not know where it is for yours. <SEP> How do i set the timing on a 1996 4.6 northstar liter engine?
i could be wrong, but i think there are 2 adjusters on the tensioner pulley. one is on a spring loaded cam, and the other is on a pivot and a elongated slide hole in the bearing. get a manual if you insist on doing it yourself. if you get something wrong, you could cause major engine damage, so get a step by step manual on this repair, and follow it carefully. a little extra time and money will save a huge headache later. <SEP> How do I pull back the tension wheel when installing a timing belt?

Certainly the removal of old grout is the first step. You don't state its condition, or if you just want to change a grout color?   Its a messy job, or can be, and care to not break any tiles.   Re grouting: When you go to a home store you will see various colors certainly, and two types of grout usually,,,SANDED and NON SANDED. One applied and dry either will work, the differences are in the width of grout lines,,, IE: Non sanded recommended for wider lines.   Mix only small amounts at a time, apply with a plastic putty knife if you don't want to invest in a runner face trowel, buy the wipe off sponge, allowing for the grout lines to be filled to overflowing, gently, with a DAMP sponge, wipe away excess. As the grout sets and dries you can apply a wetetr sponge in cleanup. The dust left behind once dry is easily wiped away.   You might also buy sealer, for the grout allowing it to be less absorbent, though I have no stats on effectiveness.Rev. Steven <SEP> How do you regrout the bathroom/shower tiles?

Note: @Joe has created a JavaScript bookmarklet which automates the process described below. It is available at joereddington.com->better-gmail-search .

You can breathe a sigh of relief because your particular car's engine is NOT an interference engine, meaning the valves will NOT touch the pistons if it goes out of time. Anybody who posts, telling you otherwise, is full of S***. Even more good news is that it is also VERY easy to replace on your particular car if you are somewhat skilled. Any place you take it to, should not charge you any more than 3 hours of labour to do the repair. Any more than that, they are ripping you off. The belt itself, is also very inexpensive, even from the Ford dealer. Are you going to attempt to replace it yourself? If so, the sizes for the fasteners are 17mm for the engine mount fasteners, mostly 10mm for the splash guards underneath, as well as the fasteners that secure the hoses up top in the engine compartment,13mm for the belt tensioner bolt, 19mm for the crank pulley, and I think two 11 or 10mm nuts that hold the timing cover.

Ok Tessiecom,  If the door you have is not a "pre-hung" door then you're in for a challenge.  Although a pre-hung door can be installed much easier than a "slab door", it can be done.  The first website below will show you how to install a door that is pre-hung.  and the second will give you some ideas on what is involved in prepping the slab door before hanging it.  I hope this helps, and I will add more as I find it.The last link is a Lowe's link, it's pretty detailed.  Another thought I had is that a lauan door is generally hollow, which doesn't leave much wood around the outside edge of the door.

I think I'd get right to the nearest GM dealership. It should still be under warranty. If you must have an appointment to get in the shop, park it in a garage or carport. Got neither?... Cover the open roof with a trash bag...if the bag will fit inside the front doors, close the ends of the bag in the doors or windows to hold it in place. If the bag is too short to reach both doors, put something bigger like a light quilt over the plastic bag. Just make sure that something waterproof is over the hole and is installed in a way that it won't leak into the interior. You may even duct tape around the plastic to cover the opening (I would only do this if I was dead sure there were no other options because the tape may be difficult to remove.)

The gratis Google Docs extension Paragraph Styles+ allows to create custom paragraph styles (plus decimal system outline numbering for headings and a table of contents with page numbering).  I just tested it, and here's my first impression:   Good start. For small-ish documents, it should be good to use :-)  However it runs quite slow, even though recent versions improved on the performance already.  The UI does not integrate with the Google Docs style UI. Probably not possible otherwise in the Google Docs API.  The original Google Docs style feature does not know about custom styles, considering all text with custom styles as having the "Normal text" format. You can use both in parallel, but note that the "Clear formatting" button (looks like " T x ") will remove custom style formatting from selected text.  It seems to store your character styles on an external web service, means you have to entrust them access to your documents the way you entrust them to Google now …   Source: Acknowledging the comment by Chris Moschini above, who mentioned it first. <SEP> How do I add new styles to Google docs?

Raise front of car and support it on jack stands unless working clearance under car is adequate. Place pan beneath drain plug. Loosen plug with wrench, then remove plug by hand. Let old oil drain into pan. Clean drain plug and washer with rags. Some plugs are magnetized to trap metal particles. he old filter must be loosened with a filter wrench. After loosening, it should be removed carefully by hand so that no oil is spilled. The gasket of the new filter is then lubricated with clean engine oil, and the filter is threaded on by hand. Follow the filter manufacturer's instructions for proper tightening procedures. Replace plug and washer as soon as the oil has drained. Start plug by hand and tighten it as far as possible. When plug is seated, tighten it another half-turn with a wrench. Find oil filler, add amount of oil given in owners manual, 1 quart less if filter is not changed. Start engine and check for leaks at drain plug. Lower car. Check oil level; adjust if necessary.  Then Start your engine up and check for oil leaks.

I have always used Bullseye primer/sealer to paint paneling - especially dark paneling because it will cover in one coat. There are no issues with coloring the sealer if it is a earthtone color because anything darker may exceed the recommended maximum amount of coloring you are allowed to add. You can also use Kills sealer but you will need at least 2 coats. The other advantage to using sealer is you do not need to prepare the paneling so it will stick unless the paneling is covered with grease or oil. In that case I would use a degreaser that has orange oil in it. <SEP> How do I paint wood paneling? I know it sounds tacky but it's my only option at this point.

As a owner of a Range Rover and two Disco's I have to say I am supprised to hear that the speedy TR7 has twin carbs.For a book I would suggest you go to the LRO site, or buy one of their mags and look through the too many adverts and you will find books on offer along with many specialty shops that love to work on rover V8s.If you would like to get driving there is a rough and ready way. Pardon me if I miss some points as my book is not with me.Here we go:  Make sure you have just the PROPER amount of oil in each carb chamber, Make sure the linkage is or cable is adjusted so both carbs function as close to as alike as you can determine, now the fun part.Find  yourself some of that small 8mm or so clear plastic hose, about 3/4 of a meter in length get two if you can. Start your engine, put the hose near your ear (one end) and the other end just down the throat of the carb-Forgot to mention you need to have the aircleaner off.  You will hear the hissing of the fuel jet as the engine runs. Listen to each carb in turn.  You objective is to get the sound exactly the same as much as your calibrated ear can allow.Set the idle screws on each carb the same number of turns (remember to count how they were set. Now set the each carb bit by bit to get the engine idle to 600 or so RPM. Keep the sound the same between each of the carbs.The models of SU's on my Range Rover have fuel adjustment screws which I then cut them back till the engine goes rough and then open them evenly (to the sound) untill it goes smooth.  Check your work by reving the engine and listening you may have to fiddle one carb or the other just a little to keep the sound and have smooth exceleration.This can be really fustrating as things like big changes in humidity and temperature effect the fuel tuning.You may find it much more satisfying to take it to a reputable garage and watch as you wax on about the pleasures of owning a classic automoble or even less stress than that, ask when you can pick it up and if it is not too long spend the time in a pub-having lunch of course you should not drink and drive.Good Luck. <SEP> How do I Balance my twin SU's and how do I stop her running rich (Triumph TR7 V8 3500).

Assuming you`re speaking residential doors, if no screws are visible on either side, most commonly you would look for a small rectangular hole in the shaft of the inside knob or lever.

The system is, or should be, self-regulating with regard to pressure and water supply.  I don't think you can affect this.  regardless of pressure, the system will circulate heated water by gravity and convection.  There should be a circulator that forces the hot water through the system and returns the cooled water to the heater.  If your system is that old, it could need flushing-something a heater tech should be called for- or the pipes might simply be clogged with corrosion or mineral deposits which would restrict the flow of water.  The "dripping" noises might be from expansion and contraction of the the pipes as hot or cold water is introduced.  What is your intent with regard to water pressure? <SEP> How do i raise and lower the pressure in my hot water base board heating boiler's pipes? I have a 1983 Boiler in my house.

im  mechanic and i am 100% honest.Have NEVER sold an unecessary repair.My key is building trust with all of my clients by first finding out the complaint.Then make an estimate detailing all visible costs.Then i take the customer in and show them the necessary repairs on their car so they can see the play in the ball joint or the cracked belt etc on their car.Warn them as best i can about other related mishaps that may occur while doing the job.Carry out the job and if anything is found above the estimate i either call immediately or show them immediately.I will even make more than 1 estimate if its big to try and group jobs together so they can save money on labour.Honest mechanics do exist just go to a shop where you can talk to the mecahanic NOT a service advisor.Talk to the peson working on YOUR car YOUSELF.I hope this helps. <SEP> How can you find a honest car mechanic?

I like to use carnuba car wax.  Since your furniture will be exposed to the same elements as your car, the auto wax will give the bamboo the same protection against the sun and rain.  It doesn't hurt the wood, gives it a nice shine that will bead up water but on really light areas it may darken the bamboo.  Depending on how exposed your bar is to the elements, particularly sun which makes it brittle over time, you will have to treat it about every 6 months.  But, you can test that by dropping water on it to see if it still beads.  You can also use regular furniture wax or butcher's wax, but it simply doesn't last as long outside. <SEP> How to treat bamboo? I was given a Bamboo Tiki Bar for Fathers Day.

Since I don't know what your vehicle is, I will give you some general tips. Your VIN (Vehilce Identification Number) is a 17 character sequence that has lots of info if you know how to read it. One of those characters indicates what transmission if came out of the factory with. You have to find the book or website that tells you which character indicated trans and what it is. You can start with the website for the manufacturer and go from there. <SEP> how to determine the type of transmission i have?

Remove the transmission pan, use an oil drain pan to catch all the fluid that will come out of the sides of it.allow fluid to drain out. The filter is easily viewed once you remove the pan. To remove the filter itself all you have to do is pull it off, theres no screws to it.  Make sure you also remove the grommet that is left in the hole where the filter came out of (it usually gets stuck in there). Replacing the filter all you have to do is push it in, usually it pops in there and when it doesnt fall out all by itself that means its on.Clean magnet on transmission pan. This is a good inspection point to see if you have any metal shavings. A little bit of shavings is normal, but when you start finding small chunks this is a sign of a serious problem.Remove all gasket material on trans pan and bottom of the transmission where the pan gasket goes. Make sure both of these surfaces are dry when replacing the gasket.Replace pan gasket and transmission pan. When tightening bolts make sure you do not OVER tighten. This could squeeze the gasket and cause a leak. Do NOT apply silicone to the gasket, they counter each other. By rule of thumb you can tighten the bolts using a wrachet holding your hand close to the head of the socket, when you can no longer turn the wratchet just using one hand then thats as tight as they need to be (75-80 lbs torque).Refill with fluid. Use any Dexron III fluid. it doesnt have to be from the dealer. Fill the transmission with 4 quarts and then start the vehicle, DO NOT DRIVE! Add the remaining amount while the car is running untill you reach the top mark (FULL or Warm) on the dipstick. This will usually take another 2-3 quarts, check the dipstick after you add each one.Your transmission on the caprice can hold 12-13 quarts total. When doing a transmission service it only lets out about 6-7 quarts.When topped off cycle the gears a coulple of times between reverse neutral and drive untill you feel it firmly gets into gear.  Now test drive the vehicle around the block (not far) bring it back and check the fluid level to make sure you are full, add fluid if needed. there your done.WARNING: if you are doing a fluid change because your transmission is having problems then there is a 50/50 chance your transmission will no longer work after you do the fluid change. In that case you needed an overhaul anyway. Sometimes the crap and material that is hanging around the fluid is the last leg of what is holding your transmission together and comes out with a fluid change. <SEP> how do you change the automatic transmission fluid,filter,and gasket on a 93 caprice 5.7liter? how many quarts

Locate the plug on the oil pan.  Locate the filter.With the car lifted, be it on a hydraulic lift or ramps or jack stands, pull the drain plug.  It unscrews like a bolt.  Drain the oil into a suitable receptacle.  Also pull the oil filter... careful, there will be residual oil that will come out.  Put the plug back in the oil pan.  Put the new oil filter on.  Put the right amount of oil into your engine.  Job's done. <SEP> how do I change the oil in a 1998 galant?
Find your #1 cylinder.  You'll probably need a manual for that, though, and the manual will tell you how to find TDC.  But if the cylinders are numbered on the motor, pull the plug (injector if diesel) on the #1 Cyl (I'm assuming it's assembled), and turn the engine until you feel the air coming out of the plug hole.  When the air comes out, check the harmonic balancer on the front of the engine.  It has a TDC mark, line it up with the 0 mark on the timing scale & you're done. <SEP> how do you find top dead centre on a V12 engine?
If the problem persists I would snake it.  You could either rent a small snake, or purchase a section of snake cord.  If you don't want to snake it the plumbing under the sink is not complicated.

No offense to the previous answers but "Don't try to re-invent THE WHEEL"   Follow prescribed instructions.   Alternating tightening of the two bolts is a good idea.   Make certain the tank was seated properly to begin with, and the nuts threaded without cross threading. The metal washers are designed to prevent damage to the rubber washers under,,,or above them. The washers,,, or at least one of them should act as a flange type thing that seats in the bolt hole and expands to fill the hole as the nut is tightened.    Having them tightened but out of balance with each other will often cause an improper seating of one or both sides.   Drain and remove the tank. Check the condition of the hardware, perhaps buying new. Check the condition of the exit hole and the seal for it. Re- seat the tank, add the bolt with the metal washer added first, then the sealing washer. Under the tank add the rubber washer, metal washer, and nut. Tighten to what seems to be a point of some resisitence, perhaps as you can see the bottom rubber washer begin to expand a bit in its compression. Refill the tank just enough to check for leaks, and if you notice any, then tighten a half or quarter turn equally on each nut until the leaking stops.   Unless the tank or its main sealing holes have been corrupted, the leaking should vanish.Rev. Steven <SEP> How do I prevent leakage around the bolts holding the toliet tank to the toliet bowl? I purchased a kit which contained new bolts, 4 flat washers, 4 rubber washers and 4 nuts.  From top to bottom, I placed the washers as follows:  bolt, metal washer, rubber washer, through tank, metal washer, nut, through base, rubber washer, metal washer and then nut.  I tightened the first nut to a point that I was afraid to tighten it any more in fear I would crack the tank.  I tightened the second nut until the tank fully contacted the base and would not wobble.
You'll probably get several answers here advising that you use a fine grit pumice. Don't do it, you'll end up with an area of frosted glass.

There are scratches on the inside of my windshield caused by my nephew attempting to "help" me remove stickers.  I suspect he used the rough side of a Scotch-Brite kitchen pad to remove the glue.

Any ideas, short of having the windshield replaced, as to how to buff the scratches out?  I don't want to make the problem worse, as it is fairly innocuous as it is.
Shut down your boiler then you'll have to drain the system below the lowest part of the radiator you want to remove. If your lucky there might be shut off valves specific to the radiator that can be closed to avoid draining the entire system. Use due caution with these valves. If they don't hold all of the water above you will be ON YOU fairly quickly. Next   you'll need to break the unions on the piping. For this you'll need a couple of 18 or 24" pipe wrenches and some strength depending how old it is. Remove everything back to the pipe nipple and close it up with some pipe caps.I'm not sure what your skill level or ambition is but this can turn into a headache pretty quick if you were to break a fitting or had an issue isolating your system. Even if everything goes smooth you'll still need a couple of friends to move the radiator if it's cast iron 'cause they weigh a ton. Good Luck. <SEP> how do I remove a hot water radiator?

Try here:  http://www.ehow.com/how_17787_remove-super-glue.htmlSuperglue (cyanoacrylate) has many uses. Besides the typical household function of sticking things together, it's used in surgical procedures and even in crime labs to develop unseen fingerprints. Originally marketed as Eastman #910 in 1958, this stuff is sneaky and it goes everywhere if you don't keep an eye on it.          Steps:  1.   Clean up any glue that is still wet by blotting it with a white paper towel or terry cloth towel.    2.   Soak the object in warm soapy water if possible and try rubbing off as much as you can.    3.   Pour a little bit of acetone-base nail polish remover on a white terry cloth.    4.   Dab at the dried glue until it dissolves.    5.   Use extra fine sandpaper to remove dried glue from the surface of an object.    6.   Try a product called Goof-Off or Z-7 Debonder.        Tips:   Hold a folded white cloth on the back of fabrics to keep the acetone from soaking through other layers.     Acetone may affect colors or melt plastic fibers, such as some nylons or carpet. Test it on a hidden area first.        Warnings:   Don't use solvents such as gasoline or paint thinner. <SEP> How can I get super glue off the carpet?
Most pressure reducing valves have a lock nut.  Loosen the lock nut, then turn the screw in or out to adjust pressure.When you achive your pressure you want, tighten the lock nut.The Uniform Plumbing code recommends no more than 80 P.S.I.A good working pressure, (test it when the water is running), is about 60 P.S.I.Good Luck. <SEP> How do you adjust a water pressure valve.

Try closing the drivers door and use the key to lock and then unlock the door see if the noise and flashing stop..  If not than it is most likely an aftermarket alarm so then you must put the key in the ignition and look under the drivers side dashboard (where your pedals are) and look for a button or toggle switch. if there is a button hold it in and turn the key to the on position, if this doesn't work try leaving the key on and push the button, if it is a toggle switch do the same proses , flip switch and turn on or turn on and then flip switch..  if there is no switch or button pull lower panel down and look for a black box (4"x6") just tucked up there some Ware look for some small Gage wires that lead to a remote switch of some sort....  report back with your findings please... <SEP> how do you find if there is a factory alarm in a 1991 240sx? we took the battery off of the 240, and cleaned all the battery acid off and also replaced the clamps to the terminals next thing everytime we open the door there is a ticking near the gages that sounds like the turn signals are one but a little faster...  at first we thought it was the fuses.. all of them are good.. then maybe a short, but i figured it sounds like a cheap alarm that was never fully disabled because the floor lights flash along with the clicking noise. i just got the 240 like a week ago. everything else is great.
all vehicles are different for drum shoes parts and emergency brake cables which back drum brakes control. no one will be able to give you a step by step as it would be too long thusly youll have to get a manual or if you want to save money go to library and ck. out manual or use there computer to print out what you need and a step by step. do yourself a favor and follow ALL directions step by step w/out using or trying to do a shortcut. if run 9into snag fix the snag FIRST before you move to next step. theyll even show what tools youll need to do job and how to adjust when finished. if you see any wet brake fluid coming from wheel cylinder (itll show you where this is) then replace the pistons,rubber seals etc. that comes very cheap w/kit. for so cheap a price for wheel cyl. kit id replace everytime brake drum pads need changing. also if inside drums arent smooth then youll need to have a machine shop turn them til smooth,,dont let any of these things worry you about price there both and all cheap. just take your time anf follow directions ONE at a time and youll be fine. <SEP> How do I change rear brakes on a 1996 sebring.?

I had a cigarette burn in my old apartment carpet because I allowed a guest to smoke. So this is what I did to get my deposit back. I went to a closet and snipped up peices of the carpet fibers in the corner so it would be notice. Just the fibers, not the carpet totally. Where the cigarette burn was I carefully cut the burnt part off the carpet fibers without leaving a bald spot. Next I used fabric glue (you can buy this at a craft shop, the kind you can make invisible hems with or just cloth craft glue) I put a couple of drops in the area I just took the burnt part up.

1st of all, if you dont know how then you might not have all the tools. true its very simple to do, but if you screw up, there will be gigantic problems. brakes are serious business. brakes that dont work are scary! now are you really ready to put your life, your loved ones lives, innocent lives and property in your unskilled hands? i picked these steps up from Murray's auto parts. you can buy a repair book for your car for $20 to tell you how to do your car. or library. that will tell you everything.this is for disk brakes. pay close attention to how everything comes off.Step 1: loosen lug nuts on wheel. jack up car remove wheel and support the card with a jack stand.Step 2: remove the caliper bolts grease them. remove caliper and old pads.  support the caliper and brake hose. Step 3: remove caliper bracket bolts. you might have screws to hold the rotor in place. (special tool imoact screwdriver.)remove rotor inspect, turn or replace.Step 4: push the caliper piston back in. (special tool maybe or C-clamp) Step 5: clean caliper pad tracks Step 6: install good rotor and return the screw (if screwed) and caliper bracket, tighten.Step 7: install pads in proper direction and caliper.Step 8: tighten in caliper pin bolts to torque.Step 9: put on tire, tighten lugs, lower car, torque wheels.

Instructions STEP 1: Spread a thick layer of fresh sawdust or kitty litter over the grease to absorb excess grease or oil on the surface. STEP 2: Allow the sawdust or kitty litter to sit for a day or two. STEP 3: Gently sweep away the dirty sawdust or kitty litter. STEP 4: Pour dry cement over the entire dried grease spot. STEP 5: Allow the cement to sit for a day or two. STEP 6: Gently sweep away the dirty cement. STEP 7: Gather dirty cement in a bag and throw it away. Do not allow the dirty dry cement to go down the sewer. Tips & Warnings The kitty litter and sawdust soak up grease on the surface, whereas the dry cement actually absorbs the stain out of the driveway. For best results, clean up grease stains as soon as they happen. Avoid further staining by using large automotive drip pans for vehicles that leak. Make sure the forecast is clear for the days you'll be using dry cement on the grease spots if they are outdoors. Dry cement and water will create hardened concrete. <SEP> How do you remove oil stain from asphalt surface? Its in a carport.

The problem with changing a sink, even if it is "standard size" is that there are many small variations from manufacturer to manufacturer. The granite may no longer match the outlines of the new sink. (corner radius may differ slightly.)  If you're set on a new sink, try to get the same manufacturer, some offer different materials in the same style sink.  Now we're getting really tricky because the ganite is seamed right at the sink. Those "arms" that reach out to the sink from either side are the weakest spot. If you're not careful, you may break them off when trying to cut the seal between the sink and granite. I'm assuming that the sink was sealed with silicone when it was installed. What you're going to have to do is:remove the faucetremove ALL the plumbing from under that sink (clearance issues when removing)remove the sink clipscut the silicone seampull out the sinkreverse the processSome things to think about, #1 The sink may not fit between the cabinet doors.  As a granite installer for years, I'm  surprized at the number of times the sink will not fit in the doors, the only way to install it was drop it in from above and then put the granite in place on top.  This happens a lot. #2 possiblility, the sink may be resting on the cabinet frame, in that case, the top has to be removed before the sink can be taken out. #3 there may not be enough room to fit your hands under the sink to cut the silicone seal. This then has to be done from above. Easier, but still have to think about it. Good Luck! <SEP> How can I change out the kitchen sink in a granite counter top?

If you didn't get the locking nuts when you bought the car then I wouldn't worry very much about it.When you sell a car, the seller buys it "as is".  IF a person called you about the locking nuts, that would be ok for them to check, just in case you DID have them.  Otherwise, the only answer you need to tell them is that you DO NOT have the nuts.When you sell a car or anything else, ALWAYS put on the bill of sale  "Buyer accepts item AS IS".  Do this even tho, as far as you know, the item is in top notch condition.  Good luck.  Pops <SEP> How do I replace lost locking wheel nuts? I just part-exed a Toyota Yaris SR 1.3 for a new Yaris T3 VVTi 1.3. The salesman called me today telling me that the parcel shelf and locking wheel nuts were missing. I knew about the parcel shelf but not the wheel nuts, but in both cases I'd never had either since purchase. For peace of mind, is it not the case that a franchised dealer can replace locking wheel nuts with an identifier code that comes with the car and is kept on record somewhere? Or does it entail throwing the wheels out altogether? Also, I assume that now the car has been part-exed I am not liable in any way for anything not present in the car. Am I right?

1)The sump pit must be below the water source and be about 24 - 48 inches deep.  2) the water must have a path to the sump pit - gravel and clay tiles.  3)The sump pit must be lined to keep material from entering the pump - use plastic sump pit liner sold at Lowes/Home depot or form and pour a concrete pit -it can be round or square -approximately 24 inches in diameter. 4)There must be a place for the pump to dispose of the water - simply pumping it outside next to a foundation will not work - it will drain back down into the area you are trying to protect. The sump must discharge into a pipe or hose that discharges well away from area protected. 5) the electric sump pump must be plugged into a GFCI circuit. 6) The pump should have a back flow preventer in the discharge pipe immediately at the pump to prevent the water in the discharge pipe from re-entering the pit when the pump cycle stops. Sump pumps are sold by horsepower - 1/4; 1/3; 1/2 etc.  The size of the pump is determined primarily by how high you are lifting the water and how fast you want to lift it. <SEP> how do i install a sump pump?

Okay.  First of all you say that the building is "square".  If you are meaning that the roof is perfectly square than you've got the a true peaked hip roof. For this type of roof all you need is the hip measurement.  The mathmatics are considered rise over run.  Rise being the height of your roof and run being 1/2 the width of your roof.  First thing first.  You'll have to decide on a pitch (angle)you want your roof to be. Nprthern homes typically have steeper roofs due to snow loads while southern roofs typically have lower pitches due to higher wind loads.  Once you have your pitch decided, we'll use a 6" over 12" pitch in our example.  If you know that your building is 12 feet wide then 1/2 of that is 6 feet.  This is considered our run.  We will now simple multiply our run (6') by our desired pitch (which just happens to be 6. 6 x 6= 36" or 3 feet.  What this all boils down to is that for every 1 foot of our run our pitch moves up 6 inches.  Next step is using yet more math to discover our lenght of rafters needed.  The pythagiam (excuse the spelling) is the math we will be using.  It's simply wrote as a2 x b2 = c2.  We know what "a" and "b" are.  A=36" and B=6'or 72". Multiply 36 x 36 and you will get 1296.  Multi 72 x 72 and you get 5187.  Add 1296 and 5184 and you get 6480.  Now let's find the square root of 6480 (Good time for a calculator). 80.49 inches.  Roughly thats 80 and 1/2 inches.  This is our rafter length for a common rafter.  For the hips will use the same equations except we will multiply our same run by the number 17 instead of 12.  Additionally the pitch for the hip will be considered 6 over 17.  which means 6 inches of rise for every 17 inches of run.  If this is all to complicated go to Lowes and buy a speed square that comes with a rafter book.  The book will tell you how to measure for your rafters and the speed square will show you the proper angle.Good Luck!!!! <SEP> how do i set out a traditional hip roof? i need to know thw basics of setting out a traditional hipped roof with a hip on each corner of a square building

1st of all, disconnect the battery cable & remember to relieve all pressure from the fuel system.  Assuming that you have a 3.1L, then  disconnect the quick-connect fitting from the in-line pipe filter.

Like most places in California, the hot topic around the water cooler at our office is the rising cost of gasoline. We have seen a drastic increase in gas prices over the past several months and we haven't even reached the summer yet. There has also been talk of premium unleaded costing three bucks by the time summer exits. Thank god my commuter is a Miata (stop laughing) and it gets a gas-sipping 30 miles a gallon on the highway, unlike my other four vehicles, which are only able to muster 20 or so miles per gallon. Keeping them in top shape is a major priority. As many of you might already know, a well maintained vehicle not only saves you money at the pump but can also increase performance. Everyday commuters can easily perform some of these tips while some require skills and specialized technical equipment. We will rate each task on a one to 10 scale so you can decide for yourself whether you can perform these tasks or if you should have a hired mechanic perform them for you.1 One of the easiest and simplest preventative steps you can take is checking tire pressure. If a vehicle's tire is not inflated to the proper specifications, it can cause additional drag on asphalt, slowing the vehicle down. Not only can the situation waste gas, but it may also lead to hazardous driving conditions. First check the manufacturers pressure rating on the tire's sidewall. It should read something like "maximum tire pressure xx". With that information, inflate the tire pressure of all four tires to two or three psi below the maximum pressure. Never inflate the tire past the maximum pressure! Difficulty: 2.2 If you love your car you must be religious, not it the sense of believing in God, but religious in the sense of changing your oil. Oil and filter changes should occur every 3000 miles or even more frequently depending on driving conditions. Changing your oil can be as easy as going to the nearest Jiffy Lube or similar establishments. If you are a do-it-yourselfer it can be as cheap as $10 if you buy all the parts from your local parts store. Dirty old oil can easily turn into sludge, hindering moving parts from moving freely, causing performance loss, poor fuel economy and increased wear. Difficulty: 1 or 3 for the do-it-yourselfer.3 Another cheap upgrade is your spark plugs. Not necessarily with high performance exotic alloy units, but just new factory replacements. An average conventional spark plug has a lifespan of about 30,000 miles. Anything past 30,000 miles, and the spark plugs electrode has probably worn off. Spark plugs should be checked every 10,000 miles for wear on the electrode and if needed, replaced with new ones. Difficulty:: 2 to 4 depending on vehicle.4 Air filters are used on all vehicles for obvious reasons of course. However, over time and depending on driving conditions, the filter can easily be clogged with dirt and debris. If the engine utilizes a panel filter, it can easily be tapped gently on the floor to remove the large debris. Pressurized air can remove the smaller debris (office duster works great). Make sure you blow the opposite direction of the air flow intake tract to prevent particles from being further embedded into the filter. Cone filters can also benefit from spring-cleaning and there are cleaning kits available to clean the filter. Air filters should be inspected every 10,000 miles and cleaned or replaced when necessary. Difficulty: 3 to 4.5 Depending on what type of ignition system your engine utilizes, some incorporate an ignition cap and rotor for transferring amplified ignition charge to the plug wires. After several hundred thousands transfers of ignition charge, the cap and rotor can wear, which can lead to misfires. The cap and rotor should be checked every 20,000 miles and replaced when the wear is too excessive. Difficulty: 4 to 5.6 Although plug wires rarely go bad, an intermittent ignition misfire can keep you scratching your head for weeks. <SEP> how to do a tune-up on an engine?

The clutch will slip, much like an automatic transmission vehicle. The revs will go up but your car won't go anywhere. These clutches are self adjusting, so once it starts to slip, it's time for a new clutch. "Something loose" is too broad to define. What does it sound like? Is it a chirping? Whining? Is it jerking/shuddering? What you're probably doing is slipping the clutch or double clutching. You'll get better at it, these clutches are durable.

With the release of the Data Export feature , you can now   Go to your board  Click the "Board Menu" button (on the right-hand-side of the screen)  Select "Share, Print, and Export"  Click "JSON"   This will download a copy of your board data.  Pro tips:   You can also just add .json (or /somename.json) to the end of a board or card URL, to get the prompt to save the downloaded file  (e.g. https://trello.com/board/welcome-board/4e6a8095efa69909ba007382/somename.json )  Alternatively, instead of clicking on the "JSON" button, you can right-click on it, and copy the URL  If you have lots of boards that you want to download regularly, you'll have to save all the JSON links somewhere for all your boards, and download each one individually.  Changing the names of all these individual files for each set of backups could get a little tedious, so one idea would be to create a new folder each time you backup your boards, and then save a set of exported files into that folder. <SEP> Is it possible to export my data from Trello, to back it up?

you may have some issue due to age of the gas control valve, you need a lp conversion kit for it which includes a different internal spring, diaphragm and cover plate.

As some of the others have stated, if your oil is a "creamy tan goo" on the dipstick, then coolant is getting inside the engine, and will quickly ruin the engine bearings from lack of lubrication.

As far as sealers go, any old tube of silicon or latex caulk would do. Just glob out enough to cover the hole and spread it so that it covers said hole entirely...allow to set.

First, if you ran out of oil it is possible you MAY have drawn some sludge into the line and clogged the orifice (nozzle) in the burner. It must be cleaned or replaced. Unless you're a good mechanic AND you know what you're doing let a serviceman do it.MORE  LIKELY,  if you did draw sludge from your tank into the supply line it may very well have 'gummed up' the in-line filter (if you have one) - most systems do. You MAY have to replace the filter element and,  if you do replace it,  fill the canister and filter assembly with fuel oil before reassembling it. This is the best way to prime the line and it saves a lot of bleeding time and by not having the canister filled you may not be able to completely bleed the system. Sounds like either a clogged filter (most likely) or a clogged nozzle(orifice) or BOTH!  One other thing - if you know when your oil deliveries are scheduled make an effort to have someone home and have them turn off the emergency shut-off switch (usually a red wallplate) prior to the delivery. Leave it off for 2 hours or so before turning it back on. The reason? When oil is pumped into the tank it stirs up the 'gunk and junk' which has settled to the bottom of the tank and this 'stuff' stays suspended in the oil for some time after the delivery. By not running the oil burner for several hours you give the 'gunk' a chance to settle back to the bottom of the tank and not be pulled into the supply line where it does its dirty deeds.Good luck! <SEP> how do i prime my oil burner/furnace? i recently ran out of oil in my oil burner/furnace, and now that the thing is full again it won't turn back on. i've already tried bleeding the thing and that doesn't work. where i live it is very cold and i need help fast!!!

Now Google Drive has a feature called “filter views”. It makes some filters available only to you while you don't change any data.   Use filter views in the new Google Sheets  In Google Sheets, filtering your data makes it easier for you to view and analyse data by letting you hide data that you want to temporarily take out of view. The new Google Sheets introduces filter views as well, which allow you to create, name, and save filters that you can use without disrupting how others are viewing your spreadsheet.  Creating a filter view  When you create a filter view, it’s like saving a filter that you can use over and over again.   Open the spreadsheet where you would like to create a filter view.  Click the Data menu, hover over “Filter views…” and select Create a new filter view. You can also click the down arrow to the right of the filter  icon and select Create a new filter view.  Using the down arrows in the column headers, sort and filter the data to fit your desired view. Your filter view will be saved as you make changes.  To close your new filter view, either click the X in the top-right corner of the spreadsheet or click the down arrow to the right of the filter  icon and select None.

The ECU is located on the front floor, about under the passenger's toes. Pull the carpet down; a large protective cover will be seen over the ECU. On the upper edge of the cover is a window or opening, allowing the Light Emitting Diode (LED) to be viewed. Turn the ignition ON, but do not start the engine. The LED should begin to flash. NOTE: In the event that a code is encountered which is not on the chart, re-count the number of flashes. If the code is truly wrong, it will be necessary to swap the ECU for a known-good unit and recheck. Since this can be expensive, you may wish to bring the car to a reputable repair facility if no other cause of the failure can be found. This may save you the expense of purchasing an unnecessary part. Once the codes are read, refer to the appropriate troubleshooting chart for testing procedures. Note that some tests will require the Honda test harness. (Use harness No. 07HAZ-PJ7010A and 07HAZ–PH7000A for 1988–89 and 07LAJ–PT30100 for 1990).

I'm not sure exactly what you mean but if you're talking about the rain water coming off your house, one way is to bury black drain tile underground and extend it several feet away from the house.  You can also connect some of the drain tile with a wye connector.  Drain tile is the black drain hose that is sold at major home supply stores.  If your yard is sloped, you can bury the drain tile so it drains away from the house in the low lying areas.  This is especially effective if you have downspouts that drain across a sidewalk.  You can bury the drain tile under the side walk and connect it directly to the vertical downspout.  One of the most effective ways to dig under a sidewalk is to use a garden hose and water pressure. They sell fittings that connect gutter to drain tile.  Drain tile is also relatively inexpensive. <SEP> How can you move rainwater underground away from the house?
You must first remove the old one.  Start by getting a drain pan.  Put it under the drain plug of the radiator and open it.  It should be a valve at the bottom that will turn with minimal pressure from a pair of pliers. Open the radiator cap to allow breathing while draining. Once drained, then you will need to remove the hoses.  Should be two, an upper and lower.  I would do the lower first.  After the hoses, you'll need to undo the two transmission lines assuming you have an automatic transmission. If it's a stick shift this part isn't necessary.  You'll likely want to "stop up" the ends of those lines so tranny fluid doesn't leak all over.  Eyeball your new equipment beforehand to make sure all these inlet and outlet connections are going to be the same on the old one and new one.  The overflow line from the cap area to a separate bottle will also have to be disconnected.  Next would be to locate whatever brackets and bolts that need to be removed to extricate the old radiator.                                   There should be a fan shroud or a fan assembly with shroud that you will have to figure how best to remove. depending on how your car is made, it may be easier to remove the whole fan assembly after you remove it and the radiator as one unit. When I did mine, there was one electrical connection to the fan assembly that was actually attached to the radiator itself.  I disconnected the electrical plug and removed the assembly after removing the radiator.  Much easier to get to that way.  Then you begin doing everything in reverse order to install the new one.  make sure you refill the new one with the appropriate mix of coolant and water.  Half and half is pretty common but you may want to consult your manual. <SEP> how do i put in a radiator?

Well...   Conversion : Students love to format their Documents (margins,borders,cover pages, advanced numbering, page breaks, section breaks) to their liking, it sucks if you are in group project and everyone else is using Word. It would be sad also if the professor sent you an assignment in .doc or .docx format and you lost information on the transfer.

If you are not packing Matlab or Mathematica then this is your saviour with non-linear equations   Other small features depend on what field and what courses but I assure you when you reach the upper levels even formatting stuff on Office for Mac is frowned upon.

hi, you're going to need the manual for the garage door opener and possibly one for the wireless remote. If the opener is also a Crafsman, then you should find all the instructions you need in 1 manual. If the previous owner didn't leave the manual for you, get the complete model number of the opener and visit the S-ears website. If the website doesn't have the manual listed, you may need to call them to see how to get an out-of-print manual. The different openers have different ways to reprogram...without listing a model number here, nobody can offer you much more help. Hopefully, though, the trip to the website will be productive and then you'll have a complete owner's manual. Good luck! <SEP> How do I reprogram the keypad to my garage door opener?

1.   Pour cola on the oily or dry stained areas, and leave the cola on overnight. Squirt a generous amount of dishwashing liquid into a bucket until you have a good lather. Rinse with the soapy water, then with a garden hose.    2.   Sprinkle baking soda or an absorbent powder such as cornmeal or sawdust on the oily spots. If the stain is dry, wet it first to make a scouring paste. Scrub with a stiff brush or push broom.    3.   Sprinkle automatic dishwasher detergent on the oily concrete. Leave it for several minutes, then pour boiling water on the stained area. Scrub with a stiff brush or push broom, then rinse.    4.   Try a commercial concrete cleaner such as Garage and Driveway Cleaner by Red Devil Co. or a grease solvent such as Benzine. Follow the manufacturer's instructions.    5.   Sprinkle trisodium phosphate (TSP) on the oily concrete. If the stain is dry, wet it first. Let it stand for 30 minutes. Scrub using a stiff broom. TSP is a dangerous product; if you must use it, wear rubber or latex gloves, safety goggles and protective clothing. Also, never wash a TSP product down storm drains.    6.   As a last resort, combat tough spills with muriatic acid and a pressure washer. Apply the acid following the manufacturer's directions, and let it soak for several seconds. Follow with a pressure washer set at 2,500 to 3,000 lbs. per square inch (psi), or 176 to 211 kg per square cm. Like TSP, muriatic acid is a dangerous product; likewise, if you must use it, wear rubber or latex gloves, safety goggles and protective clothing, and never wash such a product down storm drains.    7.   After trying any of the strategies above, sprinkle baking soda over the cleaned area to neutralize the solution you've used. <SEP> How do I remove oil stains from driveway?

The snake and camera are for sewer pipes.  To locate a pressure water leak you need A subsurface listening device such as geophones or fischer locators.  These are like stethoscopes only louder.  I hook up an air compressor to the water line via hosebib.  This makes the leak much louder.  It takes a lot of experience to locate a slab leak so I would suggest calling a slab leak specialist/plumber to locate it for you.  Sewer leaks you can find by performing a hydrostatic test and locate.  Also pretty tricky.  You use test balls to stop up the sewer and fill the drain with water.  If the water in the pipe drops you let the air out of the test ball and move it a couple of feet andtry again.  I would also recommend a plumber for this or it will take forever.  Experienced plumbers will know how to isolate the sewer pipes to make the job faster.  It takes me about two hours to do a full test and locate for drain leaks.  Around $275 to locate water leaks. $475 for sewer.  The smart plumbers will charge by the hour on sewer because it can take all day depending on how many leaks and access. <SEP> How can I locate a broken water pipe under a concrete foundation?

"Bounce" This Along -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- My mail carrier told me that the US Postal service sent out a message To all letter carriers to put a sheet of Bounce in their uniform pockets To keep yellow-jackets away. Use them all the time when playing baseball and soccer. I use it when I am working outside. It really works. The yellow jackets just veer around you. 1. All this time you've just been putting Bounce in the dryer! It will chase ants away when you lay a sheet near them. It also repels mice. 2. Spread sheets around foundation areas, or in trailers, or cars that are sitting and it keeps mice from entering your vehicle. 3. It takes the odor out of books and photo albums that don't get opened too often. 4. It repels mosquitoes. Tie a sheet of Bounce through a belt loop when outdoors during mosquito season. 5. Eliminate static electricity from your television (or computer) screen. 6. Since Bounce is designed to help eliminate static cling, wipe your television screen with a used sheet of Bounce to keep dust from resettling. 7. Dissolve soap scum from shower doors. Clean with a sheet of Bounce. 8. To freshen the air in your home - Place an individual sheet of Bounce in a drawer or hang in the closet. 9. Put Bounce sheet in vacuum cleaner. 10. Prevent thread from tangling. Run a threaded needle through a sheet of Bounce before beginning to sew. 11. Prevent musty suitcases. Place an individual sheet of Bounce inside empty luggage before storing. 12. To freshen the air in your car - Place a sheet of Bounce under the front seat. 13. Clean baked-on foods from a cooking pan. Put a sheet in a pan, fill with water, let sit overnight, and sponge clean. The anti-static agent apparently weakens the bond between the food and the pan. 14. Eliminate odors in wastebaskets. Place a sheet of Bounce at the bottom of the wastebasket. 15. Collect cat hair. Rubbing the area with a sheet of Bounce will magnetically attract all the loose hairs. 16. Eliminate static electricity from Venetian blinds. Wipe the blinds with a sheet of Bounce to prevent dust from resettling. 17. Wipe up sawdust from drilling or sand papering. A used sheet of Bounce will collect sawdust like a tack cloth. 18. Eliminate odors in dirty laundry. Place an individual sheet of Bounce at the bottom of a laundry bag or hamper. 19. Deodorize shoes or sneakers. Place a sheet of Bounce in your shoes or sneakers overnight. 20. Golfers put a Bounce sheet in their back pocket to keep the bees away. 21.

The best time to check the engine oil of any vehicle? I usually check in the morning before I start the engine. The vehicle must be park and level straight. Modern cars and vehicles have this universal color, I think it is color Orange. The Owners Manual of that car or vehicle has the location of the (orange) dipstick for the oil. The (orange) dipstick shows the level of the oil. It has the marking below the end of the dipstick either a line, a dotted circle, a punched out small circle, a xxxx that resembles the wooden file. If that falls between the marking (it has to be below the top marking), then the oil is on the right level.If you must checked the engine oil, turn off the engine and wait for 10 minutes. Get a tissue and pull the dipstick out and wipe it. Push the dipstick back all the way, then pull it out and see if the oil is between the markings below the dipstick.If you parked uphill, the oil level shows it's almost empty.If you parked downhill, the oil level shows it's almost full. <SEP> How to check the engine oil of my car?

At the pool I work at, some well-meaning parent shoved a pressure washer into a closet and stored it on its side.  The engine is a Honda GC190, and it was stored with the starter/flywheel assembly facing down.  Inspection of the airfilter showed that it was covered in what appeared to be motor oil (from crankcase breather tube maybe?) and the engine wouldn't start, it would turn over, but not start.  There is still enough oil in the engine and fuel as well, plus the oil in and around the air filter also got all over the carburetor and choke plate, so that probably is a problem too.  If anyone knows what to do to get it up and running again, the help would be much appreciated.

Plug the transaxle case with a clean rag to prevent dirt from entering the case. Use a puller/driver mounted on the wheel studs to push the driveshaft from the front hub. Take care to prevent the spacer shims from falling out of place. To install, insert the driveshaft into the hub, first, then install the transaxle end. Install the hub nut washer as shown in the accompanying illustration. Observe the following torques: Axle shaft hub nut-145-188 ft. lbs. Lower arm ball joint-to-knuckle-42-50 ft. lbs.

u can use wood filler or one of those pens by Minwax that they sell in any hardware store.  if u r lucky, u can even find sharpie markers that'll match your hardwd color (it's true...sharpie has diff shades of brown, made specifically to try and match hardwd floors...i saw this w/my own eyes when a hardwd specialist came to my home to replace a couple of planks).another (scarier) way to get them off is to use a fine grade sandpaper and sand the scratch.

Well there is no special thing to do on your car versus any other car.  Just take off a plug wire buy twisting the wire as you pull so you won't damage the wire.  Put a socket on the plug and unscrew it.  Make sure you gap it to 52-56 on the plug.  Put some grey anti-seize on the treads and screw them in to 15Nm or about as tight as a oil drain plug.  Also put some dielectical grease on the boots so the boots won't be so hard to remove next time and moisture stays out.  Then go on to the next one.  Just do them one at a time so you don't cross any wires and make sure they don't touch the exhaust.  Keep the wires from touching each other if you can so any spark doesn't just to another wire.  That's all there is to it.Also Jeep Freak has a good point on screwing them in.  The first guy is thinking of a newer mustang.

I recommend Citristrip Stripper: it's real user friendly and safe to use inside. As with all chemicals, be sure you have good ventilation though. Citristrip has a long open time and if conditions are right it'll work for up to 24 hours.

This is more useful for when you specifically want to send it to someone who is not technically inclined (i.e. you want to make it dead-easy to open), which is why I originally posted it as an answer to this question , but it works!   "Add" your .exe file to a (new) encrypted .zip file (the "inner file".)  Change the file extension from .zip to .zipx .  (Of course, other extensions probably work.  You could even make the extension .thepasswordisHuckleberry !)  "Add" the .zipx file to a (new) unencrypted .zip file (the "outer file".)  E-mail the outer (.zip) file along with the password for the inner file.   That's it.  As an added bonus, you don't even have to change the file extension.  Windows File Explorer recognizes the inner (.zipx) file as a valid .zip file, so you can just double-click it and enter the password.  This is what it looks like after opening the outer file and trying to open the inner file.  Note the .zip icon on the .zipx file.

Do you have central air conditioning combined with your furnace?  If not, there may not be a condensate drain.   The condensation is a by-product of running the Air Conditioning.Often, the inside "coil" of the AC is located in the larged duct area between your furnace and the ducting that proceeds into your living areas.  So, a furnace in the basement, typically sees the AC coil above the furnace.  Look for tubes that travel from that unit to the box that sits outside.  One of the tubes goes down instead.  it could be a white colored PCV pipe, clear tubing, etc.   Drips of water will travel this tube to drain into a floor drain near the furnace or into a condensate pump (about the size of a shoe box).  This pump will push the water up another tube to the nearest drain -- perhaps a basement washtub sink.Good luck. <SEP> How do I find the condensate drain on my furnace?

First make sure your contractor remove the burned or charred items.  This might seem obvious but on many occasions this crucial part is overlooked.  Secondly using water to clean everything might cause more harm than good. Adding water to burned or smoke affected items often times will "lock-in" the burned smell.  To insure that the smoke smell is lessened in severity ask the contractor to use ozonator in the home's environment.  An ozonator emits an oxygen-3 molecule which attaches itself to the carbon molecules that cause that "smokey" smell and renders it neutral.  There are to be no occupants in the home during the ozone's use and the house should not be occupied for 15-30 minutes after the ozone generator is cut off.  To insure that your Contractor is diligently addressing the smoke smell you may want to consult one of the many IICRC (Institute of Inspection, Cleaning and Restoration)certified contractors/consultants in your area.

Jack is right about trying the plunger first although I'd suggest using two plungers, one for the drain and one to go over the overflow (above the drain, below the faucet), if you don't block the overflow while plunging the drain, you'll just be giving the force of the plunge a way to escape and not affect the clog.If you end up using a snake, remove the overflow cap and rod it from there, not the drain. The pipe bends are not as sharp going in from the overflow, which makes it a lot easier.On a side note, it's not a bad idea to put some Drano down the tub drain once a month to help prevent build up and slow draining, especially in an older building.

Here's what I found on wikiHow.com. This should work for all cars and trucks.Before getting started, you will need these things:Car Head Lights Wire Electrical Tape Relay (see step 2 for info!) Light Bulbs Switch Fuses Mounting Brackets Hardware to attached brackets and lights. Wire Strippers Wire Nuts. If you are replacing existing lights, skip steps 4-10. 1.Purchase needed materials (listed at bottom of page). If replacing existing units, see tips. 2. Remove the lights from the box and check their amp rating. Get a switch of suitable rating. If a switch of equal or higher ratings can't be found, you will need a relay (see below). 3. Use brackets to mount them in the desired location. 4. Locate a convient place in the vehicle to mount the switch for the lights. 5. Mount the switch in the vehicle. 6. Locate a source of power under the hood that does not directly attach the wires to the battery. (One some vehicles, the headlight circuit may do.) 7. If you found a switch of the needed rating above, connect as follows: source to switch, switch to lights, lights to source. Skip to Step 11. 8. Mount the relay somewhere under the hood. 9. Attach the Light circuit to the "Load" side of the relay (some relays may call this something else). Run wire from power source's Hot supply to one of the relays load terminals. Connect the relays other load terminal to the light closet to it. Connect the remaining connection on the light to one of the connections on the other light. Connect second lights remaining connection to the negative side of the power source. 10. Connect the switch. Run wire from a power source to one of the "Control" termainals on the relay. Connect the other termainal to the switch. Connect the remaining switch termainal to the negative of the power source. 11. Install bulbs. 12. Start car and test. If selected sources fuse blows, replace and try connecting to another source. 13. If they work, proceed. If not check connections. 14. Cover all joints with electrical tape to ensure water tightness. 15. Close hood and use. Warnings :Electrocution hazard.

Blood stains can be one of the most difficult spots to remove from any kind of fabric. If you have a blood stain on your mattress, treat it with some hydrogen peroxide. Pat the stain with a towel (one that you don’t mind bleaching, preferably white), working from the outer circle of the stain in. You will notice the spot start to bubble as the hydrogen peroxide works to remove the stain. Keep applying and blotting the spot until the blood is removed. Warning: Hydrogen peroxide can bleach fabric. Using it on your mattress may bleach it. Make sure you spot-check your mattress before applying hydrogen peroxide.Also - if there is any way to set it in the sun, outside, for a few hours after you've cleaned it, the sun is a great bleaching tool.  (Plus, it helps refresh the mattress, and rid it of any unpleasant odors.) <SEP> How do you get a large blood stain out of a matress?

MeetingWizard meets criteria 1,2,4 and 5.  I think it meets criteria 3 "copy and paste list of email addresses".  An address book is maintained within the application.  Rather than tediously entering each address in the address book, go directly to "Create a meeting request".  Propose one or more dates and times.  On the next "Meeting Event Details" screen, paste your list of email addresses, one address per line or separate with a  comma, to a maximum of 50.  Select the "Add all new addresses to Address Book" box, to eliminate entering the addresses the next time.  I recently implemented this for a local community band.  Many of the musicians are not comfortable using computers, so the two click response without the need for a login was excellent.  The response rate 75%+ greatly exceeded what we were getting with just email.   It has lots of features which came in handy eg reminders to non-responders, adding additional details, printing lists of people attending etc.  The price is great; free.

If you are looking at your gas meter, you should see four dials straight in a row. Pay close attention to the numbers on the dial and the rotation of the pointer. The first dial should be read counterclockwise. Record the number the pointer has just passed. For example, if the pointer is between the number 4 and the number 5, for dial one, the number would be 4 (counterclockwise dial, the number the pointer just passed). The second dial should be read clockwise. Record the number the pointer just passed. For example, if the pointer is between the number five and the number 6, for dial number two, the number would be 5. The third dial is read exactly like the first, counterclockwise and the number the pointer has just passed. The fourth dial is read clockwise, but this time record the number the pointer is nearest. To determine how much gas you have consumed this month, record your meter reading today. Then come back one month from today and record your meter reading again. Then subtract last's months reading from this month's reading to calculate how many ccf's of gas you've used. <SEP> how do you read a natural gas meter?
A GFCI (Ground Fault Circuit Interruptor) measures the amperage in a circuit that is being used by the load on the ungrounded (line or hot) conductor connected to it, and compares it to the amount returning on the grounded (neutral) conductor. If the imbalance is more than 5 milliamps (.005 of an amp), it causes the GFCI to trip off within 1/40th of a second. Note: A GFCI is not a circuit breaker, and does not protect against a short or overloaded condition. You can legally install one in a circuit without a grounding conductor (the bare or green wire in your box) but you must attach a sticker that says "no equipment ground" to the face plate. New GFCI's come with these stickers in the package. This will allow you to legally install one in an older house that does not have grounded wiring. Hope that helps. <SEP> How does a GFCI outlet work?  Does it require a ground?
Do you use powdered chlorine? If so, try liquid chlorine, it's called shocking your pool. When my mommom next door had a pool, hers got the same way. It took us a whole year to figure it out.

I understand your frustration.  I love pigeons and have bred them for many years, but wild ones can be a pain. The plastic owls, etc., have a deterrent effect of about two days, then the birds get used to them and perch on them pretty much.  If there is no way that you can physically keep the birds out, then I would suggest another possible idea.  Go to a kite store.  Specialty kite shops often have what I call "flapping wing bird" kites. Some of these are designed to look like hawks, gulls, etc.  Get a couple of the hawk ones and post them onto stakes, etc., or from a ceiling, etc., so that they can "fly"They need to be able to "fly" intermittently, either in a natural breeze or perhaps in a fan.  I've suggested this method to a few people in the past and it's seemed to have worked.   The sudden flapping of a "predator" spooks the pigeons and if it happens often enough (without any sort of schedule that they can get used to), they usually decide the "fear" isn't worth it and go somewhere else.Now having said that, I hope you've also closed off places where they may be nesting, etc., so they don't have any urge to come back again.Good luck -- and at some point when you see others suggesting this and charging for it down the road, remember I said it first :-) <SEP> how to drive away the pigeons from my factory shed? they create lot of problem thro their droppings. tried many ways to drive them out. could not sucseed. has any one experienced this. how you are sucessful?

You can buy those mold test kits at the home improvement stores and hardware stores for about 10.00.You will need to test the air outside of the home (the control)and also test inside the home.After testing, wait a few days to see if the test kits show the presence of mold.If they do, you can then send the kits to the lab (address in the kit)for their evaluation of the kind of mold.The LAB test will cost about 30.00-40.00 per kit. A lot less expensive than having someone do it for you.If you have elevated levels of mold in the home, you will still need a knowledgeable person to show or tell you what can be done to decrease the mold count.You can email me for further info. <SEP> How can I test my house for mildew?

Solar water heaters perform three basic operations before the hot water comes out of your tap:1. Energy Collection: Sunlight is collected and converted to heat energy.The solar collector is mounted on or near your home facing south. As the sunlight passes through the collector’s glazing, it strikes an absorbing material. This material converts the sunlight into heat, and the glazing prevents the heat from escaping in a similar manner to leaving a car parked in the sun with its windows rolled up. The temperature inside a glazed solar collector on your roof can easily reach 150°C when there is no heat transfer fluid flowing through it.The two most common types of solar collectors used in solar water heaters are glazed flat plate and evacuated tube collectors. A glazed flat plate collector consists of a shallow rectangular box with a transparent glass “window” covering a flat black plate. The black plate is attached to a series of parallel tubes or one serpentine tube through which air, water, or other heat transfer fluids pass.An evacuated tube collector consists of several individual glass tubes, each containing a black metal pipe through which the heat transfer fluid passes. The space between the pipe and the glass tube is “evacuated,” so the air is removed.Although uncommon, unglazed plastic collectors can be used as a seasonal solar water heating system. However, they are used mostly for pool heating. Each collector has its advantages, and each can perform well if matched with the proper, well-designed, storage unit.2. Energy Transfer: Circulating fluids transfer the collected energy in the form of heat to a storage tank.Heat energy is transferred from the collector to the water storage tank. In some water heaters, hot fluid is pumped from the collector to the storage tank. The pump is powered by electricity that either comes from an electrical wall outlet or a small photovoltaic module located beside the collector.In other types of solar water heaters, the sun heats the storage tank directly, so the fluid in the collector is heated and rises naturally to a storage tank above the collector. This type of solar water heater is often referred to as a thermosiphon system. It does not  require an electric pump. Passive solar and solar photovoltaic-powered systems will continue to operate even if there is a power outage. The products that require electricity from a wall outlet will not operate during a power outage.3. Energy StorageSolar-heated water is stored in an insulated tank until you need it. Hot water is drawn off the tank when tap water is used, and cold make-up water enters at the bottom of the tank.Solar water heaters tend to have a slightly larger hot water storage capacity than  conventional water heaters. This is because solar heat is available only during the day and sufficient hot water must be collected to meet evening and morning requirements. <SEP> how does solar water heaters work?

Pendulum clocks usually have a small nut (usually with ridges) right at the bottom of the pendulum. You use this to adjust the length of the pendulum. This adjusts the speed of the clock.
