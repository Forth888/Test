Materials & Tools:Knife, 6 or 8 drywall screws or other flat headed (countersunk) screws, screw driver, 2 wooden paint stirrers or a wooden yardstick, duct tape, simple white glue,  some spackling or drywall compound, putty knife (or spatula), sandpaper, 6 pack of beer, paint, a framed mirror, picture, or print.if the broken dry wall is still in place or punched into the wall cavity, carefully remove it. Cut out the broken material carefully - trying to keep it in one piece or attached to the backing paper -  and save it. You're going to reuse it.Get a couple of wooden strips or thin boards that are long enough to cross the hole. Wooden paint stirrers (free) or wooden yard stick cut down to size will work. so would a wooden ruler.place one of the sticks into the wall cavity so that it traverses the hole. Hold it up against the back side of the existing wallboard and secure it with a screw on each end. You're screwing through the wall and into the wooden strip behind the wall. Repeat with the other strip so you have  2 strips crossing the hole. This is the structure to which you will attach the broken piece. If the hole is small enough or the wooden strip wide enough - only one may be required.put the broken pieces of wall on the floor FACE DOWN and assemble them in their orignial configuration like a puzzle. Use the Duct Tape to hold them together if necessary. Flip the assembly over, and glue any partial pieces on to fill in any holes, trying to achieve a relatively flat wall surface.put the reassembled wall section into the hole, securing it to the strips with either a couple of screws, or glue if the wall section is too broken up to get a screw into. all the screws should be screwed in far enough to leave a little indention. sparingly smooth on the spackling or drywall compound with a putty knife (or spatula), just filling in the cracks and the screw holes. Try to preserve as much of the original wall texture as possible - it's hard to replicate.If you don't have spakling or joint compound, use the white glue. to fill in indentions (like those made by the screws, don't try to fill it in all at once. do one layer, drink a beer while it drys, then repeat.don't worry about glue not drying flat. Sand off the excess joint compound or glue to get a flat surface.Paint and hang a picture over it. Drink the rest of your beer and resolve to not make any more holes in the wall. <SEP> How would one repair a cantaloupe sized hole in drywall in a discreet fashion with rather limited supplies?

Power washing is a Definite necessity!!! Keep the pressure under 1500psi to avoid damaging the wood. IF you are going to repaint it, you will NOT need to strip off the old finish completely. Just power wash to remove most of the peeling paint and all of the dirt. Finish with a light hand-scraper. Spot prime any bare wood areas with a suitable primer for your type of wood and repaint with an Acrylic Latex paint suitable for floors and decks. The only reason you would need to strip all of the old finish off is if it either had multiple coats of paint on it and the paint film build was excessive, OR if you wanted to change back to a Semi-transparent Deck Stain.

With just retiring one of these with nearly 200K miles, I experienced similar problem.  It was the coil.  It would start, idle rough, then die.

Carefully insert the special hook tools, for mercedes dash, on the left and right side of the dash cluster about 3/4 way up from the bottom inbetween the cluster and the dashboard and latch them onto the back of the cluster.  This usually takes a little bit of feel and manuvering.  Be careful not to hurt the dashboard.  Once the tools are firmly hooked on the back of the cluster, pull the cluster to you firmly but politely.  Do not let the tools slip off the back of the cluster as they may cause damage.  The cluster is held in by tension clips.  You may want to rock the cluster left to right as you tug on it using moderate force.  Again, it takes a certin amount of feel, be carefule not to damage the dash cluster or dash  board.  Once the dash board is releised, you may reach behind it and undue the bulb holders in the back of the dash.  You may want to twist the dash bit to gain access but be carefull of the wiring connected to it.  the bulb holder will undue by twisting them top left about 1/4 way in a circle.  When setting the cluster back into the tension clips, position the dash and press firmly on the clusters edges to re-seat it. A little silicone lube on the clips mat aid this prosses.  Be sure not to press on the cluster to hard as damage to the plastic covering may result.  This prossess is not dificult but it does take finece.

Purchase a short wire fish from Lowes or Home Depot (~$20).  Greenlee is a good brand.  Get a short one, 25' or smaller, for this application.  Drill small hole ( 1/2" diameter ) at top, where your speaker will go.  Do in a spot where there are no studs behind the hole.  Figure this out with a stud finder (~$10) or just knock on the drywall lightly and listen to the pitch difference as you move horizontally along the wall.  You want the hollow sounding knock to avoid contention with a stud.  DIRECTLY below this hole, drill another that will be slightly larger... maybe 3/4".   For bonus points, you might consider pulling back the baseboard molding so you can make your hole behind it (and thereby conceal the hold when replacing the molding).Roll out enough of the wire fish to span the distance between the holes (plus about a foot) and feed it into the upper one.  Curl the end of a thin metal coat hanger to fit into the lower hole and use it to grab the end of the wire fish.  Pull it out into the room.Tape your spreaker wire on good and pull through from above.  If you live in an older house with plaster walls, this is going to be more of a mess.  I wouldn't advise doing it.Doing this procedure on an exterior wall will work okay, but will require pushing the wire fish a little harder so it finds its way through insulation.  Your hole on the bottom may need to be a little bigger in order to successfully grab the wire fish.Good luck. <SEP> How do I snake wire through an existing wall?

if your car isn't running right and you think that it is the fuel injections system, I would try to buy some fuel injector cleaner before taking it anywhere.  I like the Lucas brand and it is only about $5 a bottle.  All you have to do is pour it into your gas tank (when the vehicle has around or less that 1/4 a tank), then fill up your vehicle with gas and don't fill it up again until you most of the tank of gas that you treated.  You need to pour it in before filling up so that it will mix properly.  Hopefully the injectors are just a little dirty.  If that doesn't work then I would take it to a mechanic unless you have experience in working on vehicles. <SEP> how do you know when ur fuel injector is getting bad or is bad?
Certainly you have boiled water in a teapot, a boiler is much the same.First it has a fuel/heat source which in your case is gas.The boiler has electrionics that open the gas valve to allow gas to the burners for a period of time.  During that short period of time there is a ignitor that sparks and lights the gas much like on your stove.  When the temperature in the house matches what the thermostat is set at the gas shuts off. (no real need to worry about the gas blowing up your house)Back to the teapot, you have put water in the teapot, there is water in your boiler, normally this water level is controled by a float which turns on the water when the level gets low and shuts off when the water gets to a normal level.If the water is too low the boiler will not start up as a safety feature to keep the boiler from burning up, like the teapot would do if you put it on the stove without water.After the water in the boiler starts boiling and getting hotter it creates steam.  You see this steam in your teapot coming out the spout.This steam is sent throught a series of pipes to the heaters throughout the house.  These heaters are normally cast iron and heavy, the steam enters the top of these heaters and cools back down to water which a pipe at the bottom of the heater sends the water back into the boiler, so normally unless you have valve packing leaking or joints leaking you need very little make-up water from your well or city.An additional note, this is a fairly quiet system, the only way sometimes to tell it is on is feeling the heater.In the Spring or Summer when the boiler is off and cool, drian the boiler and refill a couple of times to get the sludge out of the bottom to increase the effiency of it. <SEP> How does the 'boiler' work to heat the house? I have the timer set to come on 3  times a day. Is the gas supposed to come on in between these times? (I dont wanna make the house explode!) I have never seen a boiler before I came to England. Help?
I highly recommend doing a brake job when replacing the rotors... but here's how to replace just the rotors:Jack up the car. Take off tire.  The caliper will be mounted with 2 allen cap screws which need to be removed.  Hang the caliper, momentarily, with a wire coat hanger or get a friend to hang onto it.  The brake rotor should pull right off.  (You may need to give it a sharp blow with a hammer.)  Install the new rotor.  Replace the caliper and secure using the allen cap screws.  Reinstall tires.  Repeat for the opposite side.  Try not to move the brake pads when removing the brake calipers.  If you have to pry to get them off take the cover off your brake master cylinder or you might blow it out.  It's easy... you'll be fine. <SEP> how to replace acura cl front brake rotor?

OK. This is interesting. How did the water get to the lintel in the first place?  Anyway, try grouting it with a chaulking compound, colourless, to cause less masking problems later, on both sides of the lintel.

Always best to have a qulified Architect check it out. <SEP> How to stop water leakage from lintel joints?

IMPORTRANGE() appears to be the function you want.  From the Google spreadsheets function list :   Google Spreadsheets lets you reference   another workbook in the spreadsheet   that you're currently editing by using   the ImportRange function. ImportRange   lets you pull one or more cell values   from one spreadsheet into another. To   create your own ImportRange formulas,   enter =importRange(spreadsheet-key,   range). For languages where comma is   used for decimal separation, use a   semicolon instead of a comma to   separate arguments in your formula.  Spreadsheet-key is a STRING which is   the key value from the spreadsheet   URL.  Range is a STRING representing the   range of cells you want to import,   optionally including the sheet name   (defaults to first sheet). You can   also use a range name if you prefer.  Given that the two arguments are   STRINGs, you need to enclose them in   quotes or refer to cells which have   string values in them.  For example:  =importrange("abcd123abcd123", "sheet1!A1:C10") "abcd123abcd123" is   the value in the "key=" attribute on   the URL of the target spreadsheet and   "sheet1!A1:C10" is the range which is   desired to be imported.  =importrange(A1,B1) Cell A1 contains the string ABCD123ABCD123 and cell B1   contains sheet1!A1:C10  Note: In order to use ImportRange, you   need to have been added as a viewer or   collaborator to the spreadsheet from   which ImportRange is pulling the data.   Otherwise, you'll get this error:   "#REF! error: The requested   spreadsheet key, sheet title, or cell   range was not found."   "key" is of course the string in the URL for the spreadsheet that matches to the key= parameter.  I just tested it by creating two spreadsheets. In cell A1 of the first I put a string. In cell A1 of the second I put =importRange("tgR2P4UTz_KT0Lc270Ijb_A","A1") and it displayed the string from the first spreadsheet. (Your key will obviously be different.)  (The format of the function may depend on your locale. In France the formula is not valid with a comma, so you'll need to be replace it with a semi-colon: =importRange("tgR2P4UTz_KT0Lc270Ijb_A";"A1") )  NOTES:   Google currently sets a hard limit of 50 "cross-workbook reference formulas" per spreadsheet. Source: Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides size limits . (h/t JJ Rohrer )  The "new" Google Spreadsheet (soon to be the standard) removes the 50 limit of 50 "cross-workbook reference formulas ( Google Support ) (h/t Jacob Jan Tuinstra )   In the "new" Google Sheets you also use the entire URL as the key ( Google Support ) (h/t Punchlinern ) <SEP> How do I link a cell in Google Spreadsheets to a cell in another document?

You never said brand of engine, usually, for homeowners they show the simple method of draining the oil through the filler/dipstick. Though the more complete drain method can be done by taking out the lower drain plug, take a open ratchet, insert it to take it out (depends on engine though), its best to pick or roll the mower up, so its suspended by two cinder bricks by the four wheels(my method anyway), have a container to catch the old oil right below, take the plug out (loosen the dipstick to drain faster) and let it drain completely, put the plug back in good and tight, and fill er up with a good high quality oil.....

Bearing preload is usuallu set by applying a set amount of torque to a bearing nut and relaesing a certain amount of the presure on the bearing.

OK, before you go throwing countless dollars away on the rain-x and hi-dollar wiper ideas, think about this, and I'm not trying talk down, but sometimes we forget the obvious.  Your wipers are rubber, and the windshield is glass...the problem is, the wipers are hardening a bit and actually 'grabbing' the windshield when they pass.

Make sure the power is on to the furnace or blower coil. That powers up the t-stat and makes the system work. An easy check is to flip the fan on/auto switch to on and see if the fan comes on.

Degree days give you an average temperature difference from an arbitrary point (65 F) for a given time period..  This info, combined with the information from a previous years heating season, will tell you what to expect.  Since every structure is different, you must know BOTH to estimate your possible consumption.Sooo  you add up the energy use in kWh ,(or Therms) and add up the degree days for the same period and then divide to get kWh per degree day.

Not used to removing "cottage cheese" but I often remove "popcorn, knock down, orange peel" from ceilingsFollow Instructions well (messy job)1. Remove all the furniture, artwork etc from the room2. Use roll plastic and masking tape to provide cover for  the floor, taping it securely to the baseboard around the room3. Get a broom handle and remove the broom head. Tape a drywall spatula to the end of the handle. Use several layers of tape to secure the spatula to the broom handle4. Bring a garden hose through the nearest window or door.Make sure the garden hose has a spray gun attached and place it on the fine setting (water should stream out not gush)5. Start in the far edge of the room and spray the ceiling till it turns color from white to a soft gray (May take some experimenting to see the amount of water you need to use) Test area should be approx. 6ft x 6ft. Wait approx 10-15 mins to let the water soak into the ceiling.6. Check the test area by holding up the broom and scraping with the spatula at a 45 degree angle (MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT DIG INTO CEILING ABOVE TEXTURE). Use a ladder if ceiling is beyond 8ftIf the test area was OK, the texture will fall off when you scrape it, if it is still too dry add more water and try again. Once you understand the technigue, spray the rest of the ceiling, wait 10-15 minutes and then scrape off the texture.After you are done scraping, please note that you may have to use joint compund to fill small holes or cover any exposed drywall tape (paper tape). Allow it to dry overnight and sand out the repaired areasp.s. When your finished, remove all the tools from the area and rollup the texture in the plastic and discardRooster Print ?Your really gonna paint Rooster(s) on your ceiling?Well here are general painting tips:1. Make sure there is plastic covering floor2. Use a good primer - I use KILLZ 2 which you can buy at Home Depot3. Use a brush to cut the edge of the ceiling with primer(NOTE: Apply masking/painter's tape to wall where it meets ceiling for best results) Make sure the entire edge has been painted around the room at least 2 inches wide4. Use a paint roller with an extension to fill in the entire body of the ceiling. Let dry at least 2 hours5. Check visually to see if the primer has covered the ceiling especially taking note of any stained areas. Repeat using roller until ceiling is uniform in color.6. Now that the canvas has been made, use the same paint techiques for a color paint (base coat) to go over the primer.I assume the rooster print is a stencil template which can be taped to ceiling after the primer and base coat are applied. Work slowly, making sure the template is firmly flat on the ceiling and choose brush and paint in relation to the size and color you needHope this helps ...

Any modern vehicle will run on E10 or E15 ethanol, that is 10% or 15% ethanol mixed with gasoline, which is what is being sold in most places now.To run on E85 Ethanol, 85% ethanol, 15% gasoline, the vehicle needs special modifications.

The simple ingredients of baking soda and vinegar can unclog drains. Best of all, you're fixing the problem without pouring anything toxic down the drain.   Steps:  1.   Remove contents from sink/tub.  2.   Pour 1/4 cup of baking soda down the drain.  3.   Pour in one cup of vinegar into the drain.  4.   Cover the drain with a lid and wait fifteen minutes. The baking soda and vinegar will have a chemical reaction, breaking down the clog.  5.   Rinse the drain with hot water to clear it out.  6.   Repeat if necessary.        Tips:   You may need to use a plunger to help break the clog. I have also heard about adding table salt to the concoction.       Warnings:   Use each product sparingly. <SEP> How do you make a homemade drain unblocker (like draino)?
Going with Tile...good choice.  Do you know what size?  8 x 8 or 12 x 12.  Measure the length and the width of your kitchen.  Let's say the length is 20 feet and the width is 10 feet.

Here's what I've noticed.  Whenever I search for a friend on facebook, I start to type the person's name, and after the first few letters, I get a list of people who's first or last name starts with the letters I've typed.  NORMALLY, the list of friends starts with people I'm already friends with, and leads into people who I might possibly know through mutual friends.  BUT...  I've recently started dating a guy.  Now, when I type in the letter "G" to search my friend Georgia, the first person on my list is my boyfriend's best friend who's last name begins with "G".  Then I tried "K" for Kelly.  Instead of seeing my friend Kelly who would normally appear, I get a list of people with the last name Keats - my boyfriend's sisters, mother, aunt, and cousins.  I haven't visited any of these profiles before, so I'm guessing that they're all checking out mine to see what the new girl is all about.  That just goes to show that the search results are based, at least in part, on profile visits. <SEP> How does Facebook guess results when you search for someone?
remove the cover from the breaker panel and look, to start with. it could be 220 (like for a stove)usually black wires are hot wiresotherwise use a meter to check, connect one meter lead to a wire, the other to the ground wire only one wire should read 115V (110 to 120 is ok) that's the black or hot wire if both read 115 to ground check with one meter lead on each black,  see if you have 220don't electrocute yourselfdepot type stores sell meters 40-50 dollars is reasonable <SEP> how to identify white and black electrical wire from the main power source? there are two wires, both black, coming from the breaker box. how can we identify which one goes with white and which one goes with black? are there any testers that we can use, if so which ones?

I just tore out the carpet in my kitchen and I did the bathroom a couple of years ago. the best thing that i found was a good sharp paint scraper and some elbow grease to remove the glue. then a power sander will smooth and prepare the floor for refinishing.I have been told that you can rent power scrapers that work well too.

Most speedometers are not 100% accurate and tend to read high if anything. Have you changed anything on you car? Wheel size, final drive ratio, etc? Those might affect the accuracy of your speedometer. Other than the already suggested ways of timing yourself using a 1 mile road marker, you can also have a friend pace you in his car and tell you his speedometer reading or you could borrow a friend's GPS unit and check your speed on that. If you're off by more than 5%, it's advisable to have your speedometer adjusted to the proper speed by a professional as an incorrect speed reading will have adverse effects on certain safety features such as ABS and proper airbag deployment. <SEP> How can you check your speedometer to make sure it's reading right?

You might have a switch on the dash that controls your instrument panel lights, but if not, yeah, that's a wiring problem.

Check tread depth on the running surface, as others suggested. In my opinion, having at least 4 mm tread is reasonable! You should also check the tire walls: slide your hand through the inside and outside walls of the tire. If you feel or see bumps extending from the plane of the wall, that's a thread failure, the tire is one step away from flattening ! Hitting side objects/pawement could cause these problems, regardless of tire wear, unfortunately it can't be repaired. Last: when changing tires, always make sure your rims are not damaged/bent. <SEP> how can i tell if my car's tires are worn out and need to be replaced?

There are a couple of ways to extract subtitles from a YouTube video -  By specifying the language and VideoId in this generic URL - http://www.youtube.com/api/timedtext?lang={LANG}&v={VIDEOID} you can get an .xml file containing the subtitles in the desired language for a chosen video.

To  point other posts have been correct, except that you will need a special masonary bit to drill the concrete.

The broken bead will leak like others have said but should only cause a pull if it is low on air. Now another pull is alignment related. The last type of pull is from the physical make-up of the tire. The easiest way to eliminate if it is a tire pull is to have the car taken to a shop and have the front tires only rotated side to side. If the pull follows the tire from the right front you know that the problem is not an alignment issue but a tire issue. From here you have a few options, You could either have the tires rotated front to rear and the tire with the pull won't cause any more problems being on the rear, or you can replace that one tire. <SEP> How can you tell if a car tire has a broken bead?

Unless you have the numbers of the cylinder heads and block, you probably cannot tell unless you disassemble the engine to check all the parts inside. There are many different "crate" motors.

It is easiest to remove the starter to get it out of the way, along with the exhaust by unbolting it at the flange at the end of the manifold.  Then you have 2 cooling lines that screw into the trans., a driveshaft that you unbolt from the rear-differential, a dip-stick tube and the shifter linkage that unbolts from the trans. and the mount which is located at the bottom of the trans.  There is a crossmember that you have to unbolt from the frame, that is what the other end of the mount bolts to.  If you have four wheel drive you have to remove the front driveshaft and the linkage to it.  Some people also like to separate the transfer-case and the trans before removal.  There is also a speedometer cable and a few wires.  Word of advice, drain the transmission before you start.  After that the torque-convert will slide out of the front of the trans..  It looks like a big donut.  The new one will slide back on, but make sure to turn it to get it to go all the way in, there should not be enough room to get a finger between it and the transmission, and it should turn freely.  Reverse the removal and fill with fluid. <SEP> How do you remove a torque converter from transmission on a 1982 Chevrolet 3500 truck.?

Obviously JFAD has done this before,( Yeah Right)  What kind of window is it, wood, aluminum, vinyl? With the info given I would have to guess that the unit has been replaced previuosly,and quite shoddily,obviously.

First you contact your local police department -- The easiest way is to remove the ignition switch on top of the steering collum near the firewall - the key turns a rod that operates this switch and allows you to access the run / start / off  without a key -- however newer cars have more than a few security devices in place to ensure that this will not allow you to drive away with the car -- those i won't mention.The 'theory' is to provide all power requirements to the ignition circuits (including computer lines) and then engage the starter - in practice the security devices from the factory to avoid a simple jumper wire or two are numerous - and that is without aftermarket security systems. <SEP> How do u hotwire a car?

You must run a refrigerator closed for a considerable period of time (perhaps overnight) to determine if it is cooling properly.  It would help if you placed thermometers in the cooler and freezer so that you have true values.  You should check that the regulator (dial?) is set for very cold, that the door seals are in good shape and that the heat exchanger (coil on the back or underneath) is clean of dirt and dust.  Also, defrost the freezer if there is an ice buildup.  Give the refrigerator the best chance to win before giving up.  Refrigerators work best if they have lots of item in the freezer and cooler (even milk cartons of water for a test).  If the unit is still under warranty, call for service.  You may have a bad compressor if there is no cooling effect or a bad thermostat to regulate temperature.  The unit should cycle on and off if it is cooling properly.  The age of the machine should help dictate whether you have it repaired (off warranty) or replace it.  Good luck. <SEP> how do I fix my refridgerator? I unplugged it for several minutes and the plugged it back in, but its still not cooling very much.  It is running though.

Has both cars been in a flood?Even though you don't feel the carpet wet any longer, it's possible the carpet padding (under the carpet) is still damp and causing moisture--you should be able to lift one of the corners of the carpet and feel for any dampness--try and get to the lowest point if possible.If this is the case, you will have to remove the seats and interior items, remove the carpet and either replace the padding (you should be able to get similar padding at a local parts house) or simply leave it out.Jerry Christopherhttp://www.usedcarwise.com <SEP> How do you remove excessive moisure from a car that has been in a flood & constant condensation while driving?

For my above ground pool I had to buy a small adapter at the pool store. A cone reducer. It has the normal end that pops into the hose, and then it reduces down to a smaller size that will fit into my skimmer intake valve.  In-ground pools don't need the cone reducer, as the hoses fit right into the skimmer, but above ground pools it is smaller since the don't have as much water.If you are new to above ground pools, I would really recommend you to go to Amazon.com and buy a complete guide to above ground pools.

If there is oil on the shocks or dirt sticking to oil on the shocks that means they are losing oil, which means the seals are starting to get worn. There is no way to replace the oil in them so u just have to replace the shock. AFter you hit a bump does you truck bounce once or twice then stop and smooth out or does it keep bouncing and eventually stop? your suspension should only cycle once or twice after you go over a dip or bump then the shock should be able to stop it and smooth it out. IF it is not then it has lost too much oil and is getting soft. The wander doesnt really sound like shocks though. That sounds like the steering stabilizer is shot.

disc brakes are pretty simple.. you need to remove the caliper (probably two or three long bolts), unbolt the disk, remove the cotter pin, replace the disc, put a new pin in, bend it off, bolt it up. If you need to change the pads, they usually clip out. (metal clips.. like snaps). You'll need a c-clamp to collapse the caliper to make room for the thicker new pads.  After you bolt the caliper back in place, you have to pump the brake a few times before the system is good to use.   Good luck.  BTW, the Aztec is ugly. <SEP> how to change disc brakes 01 astek?

Here are two articles about changes Google has made to search which affect required terms. First Google started silently ignoring some of the search terms included in multiple term searches (making all search terms required by default was one of the reasons I originally liked Google better than Yahoo). Then more recently they stopped supporting the "+" to force term inclusion, apparently because they want to use that in searches involving Google+.  Google Just Made Bing the Best Search Engine  Google Kills Its Other Plus, and How to Bring It Back  In years past, I could have searched for things like the following and only gotten pages that had all these terms:   bengals highlights simpson   I would only double-quote exact phrases I wanted matched, such as "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"  When I noticed the first change above several months ago, I started using the + operator, which had been previously redundant:   +bengals +highlights +simpson   Now it appears we have to separately double-quote each term we require which is a pain:   "bengals" "highlights" "simpson" <SEP> Force Google search to use only the exact words typed, no spellcheck or synonyms

Your paint won't adhere for very long if you don't remove the rust.  It depends on the options you have available, if you have a grinder then a stainless steel wire wheel would be an options, you could use a smaller one on a drill.  If these aren't options then you could use a wire brush to brush off the rust or even sandpaper but it's going to take a lot of sandpaper unless you're just using it as a finish sanding.After you remove the rust then you can prime it and paint it.  Rattle can will probably be the least work.

When inspecting the belt, if it appears to be glazed (shiny), show cuts, cracks or other deterioration on either side or on the edges, has chunks missing from it, or is merely noisy—it has to be changed. It's helpful if you can determine the cause of a particular problem—from normal wear to damage—so you can be assured that the replacement belt will last the full duration of its service life.   Before taking off the belt, check your service manual for any helpful tips that apply to your specific vehicle. One caution: as belt tensioners are sprung very tightly (some tighter than others), any "slips" involving the wrench used to loosen belt tension can cause serious personal injury, as well as damage to the surrounding area under the hood. Ideally you should use the special service tool designed for belt-tension removal (via the tensioner). Be aware of where the tool will be positioned when tension is removed and make sure the tensioner is resting on its internal "stop." Obviously, if the tool contacts another component before the tensioner stop is contacted, tension is not completely released and the tool will "jam" if left to rest in that position. The possibility of the tool slipping off of the tensioner is high, and injury will likely result. Once tension is properly released, it's time to remove the belt. Start removal from the most easily accessed and largest pulley having the least amount of belt contact, if possible (sometimes this is the tensioner, sometimes not). Usually, it's just a matter of pulling the belt clear of the other pulleys and right out of the engine bay. However, sometimes engine mounts or other components such as splash shields first need to be removed. Once the belt is out, here are a few other components to inspect: > Coolant pump for leakage (will cause belt noise if coolant gets on belt) or bad bearing > Fan Clutch (if equipped) for fluid leakage > Fan for damage (especially a problem with plastic fans) > Tensioner unit for noisy pulley bearing or wear on tensioner mechanism > Idler pulley(s) for noisy bearing or irregularly worn belt contact area (especially a problem on plastic pulleys) > Any under hood component that is making contact with or is close to the belt, tensioner, or any pulleys > Any other source of fluid leakage onto the belt With all of that correct, the belt can now be installed. Since all replacement belts are not created equal, get the best quality belt possible. The same cautions highlighted earlier should be observed on reinstallation. Be patient. Route the belt in reverse order of removal, keeping especially vigilant about making sure that the belt ribs are set correctly in the pulley grooves, and the back of the belt is squarely contacting the tensioner and idler pulley(s), before starting the engine. If applicable, note the tensioner position "scale" (its arrow should be somewhere between the two lines on the other half of the tensioner, preferably on the "tight" side). If it's way off, the belt may be incorrect. phew...hope that helps. <SEP> how do I change the serpentine belt on my 01 dodge intrepid?

One way is to log in using a mail client that supports IMAP . You can then export the emails to a backup location, but this is a bit laborious.  If you want a continuous backup, you could try something like imapsync . This would require you to run your own backup IMAP server and schedule a regular task to perform the synchronisation.  Edit : Preserving labels should work fine, but not quite in the way that Gmail handles them. I've not seen any IMAP or POP3 servers which handle the Gmail label system properly. Gmail presents each tag as a separate folder through IMAP, so as far as the user is concerned, the message exists in several places. (In fact, the inbox is just another label). If you synchronise your account to another IMAP server, you will essentially have multiple copies of the same message. <SEP> How can I back up all emails stored in my Gmail account?

The glass doors ride on wheels in a track on the top rails. They are removed typically by holding onto the door and then lifting the wheels out of the track and the doors come off. Sometimes they are just riding in a track and you can lift them straight up and out, and sometimes there are smaller holes in the track that you have to line the wheels up with in order to get them out. If you take off the doors you might not have to take off the rails if it is OK with the rails in place (and then you can put the doors back when the baby grows up!)Once you take the doors off then you can see how the rails are affixed to the tub/wall. Typically there will be screws on the end of the rail that extend into the wall (typically the bottom rail isn't screwed into the tub). Take the screws out. The top rail should come off pretty much when you take out the screws. The bottom rail also has silicone sealant on it. You can carefully cut away the biggest parts of the silicone to get the bottom rail off. Then you can carefully scrape off the remaining silicone.Hope this helps. All in all not a difficult job, although tedious getting the silicone sealant off. <SEP> How do you remove glass shower doors and railings on a bath tub?

Try locating the drawings for your home.  We (Florida) are required to keep residential plans on file for 15 years.  Hopefully, your truss engineering would be included in those plans.You can very easily get an opinion from a licensed architect or engineer with your truss engineering.If it was conventionally framed (i.e. 2x6 or 2x8's) then you need the span distance, your first floor construction criteria and your footer design.  Not to knock calling a contractor, but I would run the information by a licensed architect or engineer.  They would have to provide you sealed drawings for your permit anyway. (Sorry, maybe not where you live but in Florida for sure.)I would not do anything with the space if you are unsure.  If the space was not designed for attic storage, nevermind a habitable living space - the end result, such as a collapse may not even be covered by your home owners insurance if you don't do it properly.Maybe contact your local building official, perhaps they would answer a question or two.Best of luck! <SEP> How do you know if an attic is strong enough to be a living space? Ours is empty, and someone said the floor won't be strong enough for us to turn it into a living space, or to even store anything heavy in there.

No clever tricks here. You'll have to remove the roof covering (shingles) by pulling the nails carefully under the exposed part of the shingle. Get a nail bar for this. Remove enough shingles to expose what sheathing needs replacing plus a bit to give you "tool room". Cut out the bad sheathing using a circular saw set to just a tad deeper than the thickness of the sheathing. Cut out the bad stuff as squarely as you can splitting the cut on a rafter so that you have a nailing surface on each end. Replace the sheathing to match, replace the shingles putting a dab of roof cement over each nail and paint everything to match. You may need to replace underlayment and drip edge as well. Work carefully, measure twice, cut once, don't cut nails with your new saw blade, visualize what you want to do and think before you act. The hardest part will be removing and re-installing the shingles. Don't pound on exposed surfaces of the shingles. Keep everything square.Thanks to nailpounder and samhbane :) <SEP> how to repair roof sheathing? The front left corner of the roof has the edges of the sheathing damaged.

Some real old furnaces have a small metal post above the pilot light.  You have to heat the post and hold the pilot button pushed in.  the pilot will keep the post hot. This is a safety feature. If the light goes out, the post will cool down and cut off the gas.  This system is used in most propane hot water tanks in RV's.  The same principle applies in modern electronic ignition furnaces.  There is a flame sensor, that will cut off the gas supply, if the flame goes out. <SEP> How do I relight the pilot light on a gas furnace?

Since nobody wants to tell you what to do...I will. Get an oil drain pan. Get 4to 5 quarts of oil and the recommended oil filter. Put the drain pan under the car directly under the oil pan drain plug. Use a six point socket or wrench, And an oil filter wrench that fits your cars oil filter. The six point ones help keep you from stripping the bolt head. If it seems tight bump the wrench in the direction you need to go.with your hand. A bump breaks free bolts that you can't get loose a lot easier. Try not to drop the drain bolt in the drain pan unless you get one that has a catch screen designed to keep things from falling into the oil drain pan. Once the oil has drained. Reinstall the drain plug. Make sure if it has a gasket on it that the gasket is there when you reinstall it... It can be over looked if the gasket fell off the plug..Next. Remove oil filter using the oil filter wrench. Unscrew it and let it drain in the pan. Then physically look at the filter and make sure the rubber gasket is still on the old filter. It is possible for the filter to come off,and the o ring gasket to stay stuck on the engine... This is a big no no. Because if you screw the new filter on with the old gasket in place it's not gonna seal and make a huge mess when you start your car. Now that you know that you don't have the old gasket still on, take the new filter and put a light film of oil on the gasket of the new filter.... You can use new or old oil to put on the gasket..It doesn't matter. Screw new filter on as tight as you can by hand. Then take your filter wrench" and I only say this because your a femal and may not have the hand strenth to get it tight enough with out the tool. And tighten it another1/4 to 1/2 turn. Then just fill it up with oil. Put in 3 quarts and check the dipstick. Then just keep adding oil till the dipstick finally is on the full mark. Then start your vehicle. look under it and see if you have any leaks.... Turn the car off and wait 1 to 2 mins and check the level again. Then just fill as needed till oil on the dipstick where it should be and your done. I was a little too detailed but that's because I'm guessing you've never changed oil in anything before by yourself <SEP> how do i change the oil on my fiesta 1.1 lx?

To get rid of crabgrass it helps to know its life cycle. When spring soil temps (at a depth of 2"-3") reach 55-60 degrees Fahrenheit, the first crabgrass (also spelled "crab grass") seed will germinate. From mid-summer to fall, crabgrass produces seed. The crabgrass plants (but not the seeds) are killed by frosts in autumn. Preemergent herbicides (also spelled "pre-emergent") come in either granular or liquid form and kill crabgrass seedlings as they germinate.Think of preemergent herbicides as forming an invisible shield across the soil surface that stops emerging crabgrass dead in its tracks. This shield image will serve as a reminder not to practice core aeration on lawns after applying preemergent herbicides, since doing so would only "puncture" the shield. Aerate lawns beforehand, instead. <SEP> How do you kill crab grass?

For all of these, you are trying to reach the mechanism and move it back and forth to clear up a jam. Motor hums but there is no grinding.Turn the power off to the disposal for safety while doing these. You wouldnt want it to kick back on you or shock you.There may be a hex nut that you can reach from the top using a socket, extension and breaker bar.There is a special wrench made for reaching inside and grabbing onto the blades for applying turning power. See if these can be rented from a hardware or plumbing shop.Two short (2') sections of broom handle, put in through the top and jamming up against the impeller blades, then crossed from above to provide a pivot, will let you apply torgue (turning force) to the grinding mechanism.If those methods don't work for you, you may have to drop the disposal and work on it on a bench.In terms of cost of labor, if it's not a fast and simple fix it's usually more cost effective to replace a garbage disposal than it is to repair one, especially when replacing with the same brand. Within brands the plumbing, electrical and mounting collar are usually the same and with all these going for you they can usually be replaced in 20 minutes or less. <SEP> How to fix a GE garbage disposal? suddenly stopped grinding; only hums now
Most trailer wiring kits have you use the frame as the ground system. I recommend that you run an extra wire to each of the lights for the ground. The trailer chassis is not reliable when it gets old and weathered.With that said, you need to energize the plug with the vehicle that you plan to hook up to. Check the running lights when the parking lights are on, then the brake lights, then each of the directional signals.Also, your vehicle is not set up with a towing package you may need to change the blinker relay to a heavy duty type. The extra load may cause the directional signal lights to not work properly. They may flicker instead of flash. <SEP> how do you use a lamp tester when wiring a trailer?

Old caulk is tough. Use DAP Caulk softener.  It applys like a paste over the odl stuff. Be sure to cut the edges with a knife first. Let it sit and after 20 minutes, use a scraper designed for bathtubs (also at Homedepot or Lowes) and scrape it off. The majority will come off now. You may have some small areas where you need to work it with the utility knife and apply more softener.Clean the entire area and rinse well and let dry. it is critical that it be dry and free of soap scum, mildew and caulk softener. Then get a good bathrub caulk. I like the ones with some sort of buiguartd to ward off mildew and recaulk. Apply a small line of caulk all around. Wet your finger, and go back and smooth it out gently. It really does not take a lot to do this. You can always add more after, but it is harder to remove excess. Let it dry for 12 hours and preferably 24 hours.Good luck. <SEP> How do I remove old caulking from a bathtub? I want to recaulk the tub, but I can't get the old stuff off.

Sounds like the gas has evaporated in the carburetor bowl.  When it evaporates it leaves a varnish film which will cover the jets and probably has the float needle stuck in it's jet.Do this:  Take the air filter off the carb, look down into the carb, take hold of the throttle linkage and move it to full throttle a couple of times.  You SHOULD see gas squirting into the throat of the carburetor.  If you don't it may still be the carb is stopped up, the fuel pump valves are stuck OR the gas filter is plugged up.   It is something that you will have to check. To check the flow of gas to the carb, take the gas line loose from the carb, put the end of the gas line in a suitable container and have someone turn the engine over.  If you get a good gas flow into the container, the fuel pump is ok.  Then lean more toward a stopped up carb.   Good luck.  Pops <SEP> How do I get my Ford 302 V8 running after it sits for a year?

Remove the drive shaft.  Support the engine because it will want to drop down when the cross member/rear engine mount is removed.  Remove the rear engine mount and transmission.  Remove the starter.  Remove the bell housing.  Remove the inspection plate.  Now you should be able to see the torque converter as well as the flex-plate and starter ring.  The torque converter is bolted to the flex-plate.  If you move to the front of the flex-plate and inspect it you should see some nuts around the outside of the plate.  These nuts hold the torque converter.  As you remove the nuts you will have to lever the flex plate around to bring each successive nut down to the 6 o'clock position for removal.  After all the nuts are removed the converter will fall out.  A piece of rope or a strong wire is a good idea to hold it in place while you remove the nuts.I check my mail at least twice a day.

I totally agree with "thefarmersson" in the above post.  If an A/C system requires recharging, that means that there is a leak in the system.  A/C systems are closed systems that should never need to have additional freon added.  Unfortunately, the parts stores that sell freon don't really stress that a proper diagnosis needs to be made prior to adding additional freon.  Make sure you have repaired the leak in the system prior to adding additional freon.  Assuming that you have already done so, you will need the following: a vacuum pump and preferably a set a of r134a gauges or r12 gauges depending on your year model.  The purpose of using a vacuum pump is twofold.  It helps get all of the moisture out of the system and by pulling a vacuum on the A/C system, you can verify that your repair to the leak in the system is fixed.  To verify that your repair worked, hook up your A/C gauges to the service ports and proceed to operate your vacuum pump.  After running the vacuum pump for 20 minutes, your low side a/c gauge should indicate that the system is under about 30" of vacuum.  Shut off the vacuum pump.  Let the vehicle sit for about 20 minutes and then come back and check the status of your gauges.  If the low side gauge returns to 0 psi, or "atmospheric pressure" it means that outside air entered your a/c system and brought the pressure back up to atmosperic pressure, indicating a leak.  If this occurs, there is no point to charging the system with more freon because it will just leak out, and you will have to go back to the drawing board and attempt to find another leak.  However, if the gauges remains close to 25" to 30" of vacuum, the system is ready for charging.  Hook up a can of freon to the yellow charging line on your a/c gauges.  With the engine off, open up the charging port on the yellow charging line and then open the low side port on your a/c gauges.  This will allow freon to start flowing from the can into your car's a/c system.  Once the freon stops flowing, turn on your truck's engine and a/c system.  The a/c compressor should kick on and start sucking more freon from the charging can.  If the compressor does not kick on, there is an electrical problem present, which would be a totally different subject.  Basically, after the compressor kicks on, continue charging more freon into the system through the low side of the a/c gauges until your gauges indicate about 30-35psi on the low side and 200-250psi on the high side.  If everything is working properly, you should experience a 40 - 45 degree a/c vent outlet temperature.  If this all sounds too complicated, I would reccommend taking the vehicle to a reputable technician in your town who has the proper equipment to do the job.  I don't reccommend these quick charge kits that the parts stores sell because they do not include pressure gauges so you don't know if you over or undercharged your system.  Proper operating pressures are essential for proper operation. <SEP> how do  I recharge the air-conditioner on my dodge pickup?

Check the hose, wand and cleaning tools for obstructions. Debris often collects where one part plugs into another, or where the hose connects to the main vacuum housing. Remove the parts one at a time and remove any debris you find.  Clear any hidden obstructions by pushing a broom handle through the hose and wands.  Reassemble all the parts.  You may also have to replace the drive belt.1. Unplug the machine and flip it over so you can access the agitator brush.  2. Unscrew the bottom plate that holds the brush in place, using a screwdriver.    3. Lift out the brush by pulling the roller ends out of the slots in the vacuum base. If the drive belt isn't completely broken, one end will be wrapped around the agitator brush, the other around the motor drive shaft. Slide the belt off of each part. Take it to a hardware store to get a replacement.    4. Inspect the agitator brush before installing the new belt. Sometimes thread or hair will wrap around the ends or elsewhere on the brush roller. This can prevent the agitator from turning and cause a belt to fail prematurely. Cut any thread or hair with a sharp knife and pull it off.    5. Install the new belt. Slide one end over the agitator brush and the other over the drive shaft. Then reinstall the agitator brush. You may have to pull on the agitator brush to stretch the new belt a bit so the roller ends fit into the vacuum base.    6. Reinstall the bottom plate. <SEP> How to fix a vacuum cleaner?

This way it doesn't look like a duplicate to Gmail and is actually delivered.  Next, on the receiving account, I decided to go ahead and mark the message as spam. I read in the help that it mentions that marking a message as spam is reversible. They even give an example of how a user might accidentally mark a message as spam, then undo it. This is exactly what I am hoping to emulate.  After marking the first message as spam, all the others (which contain the exact same body and only differ in the subject by one letter) are sent to spam as well.  Once I was done with the testing, I marked all the messages as non-spam. Hopefully Gmail treats this as a user accidentally marking a message as spam and doesn't resort to blacklisting the address or doing something worse.  Update: After trying this again, I had to mark a message as spam twice before anything started happening, and then I noticed weird behaviors on the account that was sending the "spam". The account was automatically logged off, and I couldn't log back in for a while. This might be an automated measure Gmail takes when users report other Gmail users as spammers. <SEP> How can I purposely send a message that will be marked as spam in Gmail?

There is a small knurled nut at the bottom of the pendulum. Turn it one way to speed up the clock and the other way to slow it down. If you grasp the nut in your right hand and move your thumb from right to left, you should slow the clock down because you are making the pendulum longer. Turning it the other way shortens the pendulum and speeds the clock up.Take very small adjustments in the nut, maybe a quarter turn or less. wait half day or so to see it the adjustment is too much or too little.I usually keep my mechanical clocks a little slow because it is easier to adjust the time by moving the minute hand forward rather than stopping the clock and waiting for time to catch up.CAUTION: Never try to move the minute hand backward and do not move the hour hand at all. <SEP> How do you set a pendellum clock?

While Citrus oils, cayenne pepper and such will keep cats out of your garden, unfortunately you have to keep applying it every time it rains.  The best thing I've found is Coco Bean Mulch.  A left over product from coco bean production, it smells like chocolate. It is very light, but when you put it down, and wet it, it forms a mat that is difficult for weeds to get through (a harmless fungus grows through it and increases the mat effect).  In addition, every cat that has ever visited my gardens since I put it down hates the smell and the texture and stay away.  I had some cats that seemed to like leaving deposits in my grass, but I crushed some of the shells, and spread the dust over the grass where it settled down and was invisible, and cats no longer even come into the garden.  It seems to work for a long time; I haven't put any new mulch down for a year.  My daughter uses it, and her cat only stays in the garden long enough to go in and out the door.Unfortunately you do have to keep dogs away from it, as they like the smell and will eat it, and in large amounts, it is poisonous to them, just like chocolate is. <SEP> How can I stop cats from SH!TING in my garden.

I finally figured out the Facebook search bar trick!! So for years there's been this rumor that the search bar is the key to finding out who views your FB. They say it's just a legend... Not really!! So legend has it that if you type in a letter, the first result is either the person you searched for/looked at last... Or if you never have, that person has looked at you! Or they search for you frequently, or both.  ( It also works based on interaction, for friends especially, but I have found this to work for friends who never interact with you, as well as friends of friends who have never had interaction.)  So I conducted a little experiment and found out that the trick does work - but ONLY IF YOU'RE BOTH SEARCHING  for each other! That's the missing link. I had someone view me... Nothing. They were still in position 4 down from the top. I search for someone else, who has not viewed me, and nothing - they're still a low result. But then I search for the person who viewed me on the same day, and boom! Less than 3 hours later, they were result number one when I typed in their first or last name initials!! Incidently, this works for friends, or friends of friends, even those who only have one mutual friend in common with you!  (Important: don't try to cheat by partially typing their name. First initial only, for first or last names! Also, this works for the full-site FB, which I use on my phone as a modification to the mobile FB. It does not work with the iPhone app.)  If you search for someone, friend or not, they will still show in your top 5 results for up to a day or so, then they rank lower and not even show in your top 3 if you don't search again. If you search for someone and they instantly (about 3 hours later) rank 1st after that, they've been searching for/looking at you too! If they eventually drop in ranking, either another one of your friends with the same initials interacted with you recently, or you're the only interested party...  Of course, this will be difficult to track if you're stalking them and click on them several times a day, LOL! But I've found that one single search is enough to set it off. ( I keep track of my searches by using the search log. Clearing your searches can throw off results after a couple of hours, too.) I've tried this experiment on multiple days... Same results. (In case you're wondering where I find the time, the answer is that I don't sleep a lot!) <SEP> How does Facebook guess results when you search for someone?
you must shut off the water, turn off your hot water heater, drain all pipes (hard to do on horizontal runs without compressed air), starting at the lowest and going up.  You must open all faucets and flush all toilets.Be aware, if you have galvanized pipes, that you MAY make one problem into TWO..  namely that rust corrosion may break loose during draining and refilling and the loose particles may travel to inconvenient locations like:Shower heads, washer hose screens, faucets aerators, ice cube makers, ad nauseum and ad infinitum..If this is a recent development, then relieving air hammer this way should work..

High performance parts for this car are probably few and far between, as there is not much demand for them. (my opinion)Start by checking to see if K&N makes a air filter for it.

Piece of cake.  Just have all the tools ready before oil is pouring out of the oil pan.  RAGS RAGS RAGS(can't have too many)  Correct size wrench, two gallon tub or something with high sides to minimize splash, oil filter wrench.  You can go to your local auto parts store to get the right amount and grade of oil.  Get a new filter too.  Warm up the oil by running to the auto store.  This ensures you get most of the contaminants out of the oil pan, which is the whole idea behind oil changes.  You're going to have to get under the car.  I prefer ramps, if you can get some they're lots easier to mess with than jacks.  You can rent these pretty cheap.  Have a little tub that will hold a couple gallons or so.    Figure what size wrench fits on the plug.  Un-screw the plug (lefty lucy righty tighty).  Be careful the oil is warm!!  Just let the plug and all go into the tub...you can fish it out later.  Let the car drain real good.  Then take off the oil filter.  You might need a filter wrench.  When installing the new filter just use your hands.  If you insist on using a wrench go easy...overtighen it and you will be sorry when it gets warm.  Don't forget to put a little oil on the new gasket on the filter. Here's where I usually screw up...don't forget to put the plug back in the pan.  After that is done carefully pour the four of five(depending on your vechicle) quarts of oil back into the top of the engine.  Start the car up and look at it real good.  Let it run a while and see if it leaks anywhere.  Now that the oil filter has oil in it you will get an accurate reading on the dipstick.  You might want to back the car off the ramps or let it down if you had it up on stands so the car is level.  Turn the car off and check the oil again to be sure its right.  Shouldn't take you more than a couple hours taking your time...Hope this helps... <SEP> How to change oil in a '98 Stratus ? I need to do it for my self.?

Ok First of all Most stain you need mineral Spirts to clean the brush out.Most of the stains and clear coat materials out on the market will say right on the front of the can WATER BASED.When it says this you clean it with warm water.Other then that you  need Min-Spi to clean the brush out.Next part of your question when you clean your brush out it does not need to be 100%dry but you need to get as much of the min-spi out you can do this by whipping it or placeing a dry rag down on a flat surface put the brush on it then fold the rag over and press down. Always remember when you clean a brush out no matter how good you do this 99% of the time after the brush dries out and when you go to use it again it will seem stiff all you need to do is brush your hand it will make the brush nice and soft again.PS- Always read the can before use. If you were to use Min-Spi on a water based stain the Brush can never be used again for water based again.A thing to remember just like with paint Latex paint you can always paint with latex or oil paint.But oil based paint you cant use latex on it.Once a brush or roller has been used for stain or oil thats all it could ever be used for again. But you could use a latex brush and go to oil but not back.And also the other answer that was givin if you were to use a brush and use it again 8 hours later you could rap it up but it would be better to put it in a can of Min-Spi this will make sure it dont dry up all all and all you need to do is whip it and dry it with the rag as good as you can.I have been in the field for 20 years and most people ruin brushes like this all the time. Read The can and Take your timeGoodluck <SEP> How to clean a brush that was used for staining? I was told to put the brush under water.  But it only became little gooey!

The HT leads are the high tension leads that link the spark plugs to the distributor and are very easy to replace. Firstly you need to check manufacturers specifications for ht leads because if wrong leads are put in it could cause all sorts of problems. Purchase the leads then simply change one at a time starting from cylinder 1 and making sure it goes to the correct connection on the distributor cap. One of the leads which we in the automotive trade refer to as the king lead looks slightly different to the rest and connects the centre of the distributor cap to the ignition coil. Failure to put the leads in the right place on the cap will result in the spark occuring in the wrong cylinder at the wrong time as leads are placed on the distributor cap in the firing order of the engine. This will certainly show itself as a loss of compression(engine power) <SEP> how to replace ht leads?

There are no symptoms of when your timing belt needs to be replaced.

Actually, a wetter mix of cement will adhere better than a stiff mix. Found this out through trial and error while patching my stucco, a stiff mix will just fall off. You can do this, just trowel it on. If you find it's not working, you might need to tack on some wire mesh. However, I agree that this would only be a temporary fix, it will soon start cracking along with the brick.

Well Im a Plumber and you have a problem.Lets start with the water 1st Check near the unit in the bathroom there should be a valve at every unit. But this is not always the case. If not go to your basement or where the main unit is and look for the shut off there. The only thing is Most of the valves have not been turned off in 30yrs and they dont close all the way or they close but wont open again. Now for the pipe. Well No easy way to say this It needs to be replaced.There are lil fixes you can try They have lil clamps with rubber on the inside of the clamp you put it over the pipe and tighten up. But no matter what you do this is only a quick fix. The problem with solder is it dont work with water and also if the pipe is bad there is a 95% chance that the whole pc is bad. This is not a easy thing to fix though.I would suggest to call A Plumber not just anyone Call someone that works on these kind of units. I have seen some really bad jobs by plumbers that think they can fix anything that moves water and made it 10times worse.

since most wallpaper is vinyl faced now, i take a utility knife and score it into 12 inch wide sections,peel off the top layer (vinyl),spray water onto the paper,and use a putty knife or drywall knife to scrape off the wet paper.Keep the paper backing wet to get the best results.You can also use a heat gun to get the vinyl facing off.I have used a steamer before,but it was just a big mess and really didn't speed things up that much.You will have to do some drywall touch up when done,but that is the way it goes when taking wallpaper off.

Typically the water will penetrate the varnish and erode the finish.  The resulting exposed wood will appear lighter.  If you dont want to replace the trim or remove it for refinishing you might want to try lightly sanding the areas where the wood is exposed and staining these area with a stain that you can most closely match to the trim.  Then coat the trim in this area with a marine type varnish following the instructions on the label.  You will find that brushing the varnish over the area will blend in the newly stained areas and while it wont look perfect it will look much better than it did.  You will want to test the varnish you are useing on a small out of the way area to make sure it is compatible with the existing finish. <SEP> How do I get water stains/discoloration off of the wood trim around my counter tops?

Trello doesn't (currently) have a way to link items directly to each other.  The approach that works for me is to use a "waiting" -label on items that are stuck. This way they can maintain the context that their lists provide. And since items can have multiple labels it doesn't conflict with any existing labels either.  Of course, if your lists don't contain any context worth maintaining, a separate list for waiting items works well too.  For updating the state of the dependent card, I suggest Bob Snodgrass's answer of adding a checklist item for each prerequisite card, that says "Add note on dependent card X when complete". Or if you need further organization, you could even create a "Dependencies" -checklist on the dependent card with items for each prerequisite card. Then people completing the prerequisite card can just go mark their card as done.  The best feature of Trello is how it keeps all the features simple - so that's probably why there's no dependency, since it would make things more complicate. That said, I think a feature to link items (if kept simple and clear) would be a wonderful addition, as it is a basic element of keeping work organized. <SEP> How do you handle dependencies between cards with Trello?
What size engine?You can take the tension off of the belt and spin the pulley.  If it rolls easy and doesn't wobble it might not be the pulley.  There should be a diagram of the belt path someplace under the hood if not note the belt routing (It’s IMPORTANT)Also note that if that belt comes off while you're driving you lose your power steering your water pump alternator etc.Assuming you're still feeling brave and aren't afraid of skinning your knuckles (Oh Yeah you'll do that) Most newer gm engines use a single idler pulley that doubles as the belt tensioner. When you go to the auto parts store they are just going to sell you the pulley itself so you'll have to use the old tensioner arm.Your first step is to get the belt off.  There will be a bolt on the center of the pulley.  Some of these bolts have a reverse thread on them. Put a large wrench of the exact size on the bolt (If you use standard wrench on a metric bolt you'll strip the bolt and hurt your hand, (you were warned....) You have to pull on the wrench to take the tension off of the belt, at the same time pull the belt off of a pulley or two then slowly ease off of the wrench, don't let it slam back.After that just take the pulley bolt out, replace the pulley, reverse the process making sure you follow the belt path.While you're at it check the belt itself this could be the source of your noise and you may want to replace it now.  Also note that if your belt is bad it is most likely time to replace your radiator hoses.You may want to check out your local library for a shop manual for your car.  It will show you lots of pretty pictures ;-)Good Luck. <SEP> how do i change an idler pulley? my idler puuley is make noise , how do i change it. I can see it but i cant get to it.

Squeaky floors are fairly common, and there aren't many homes that do not have at least one. Although they're aggravating, they do not necessarily indicate anything seriously wrong with the floor or its structure.Many things can cause a floor to squeak: warped boards that rock when stepped on; cheaply manufactured floor strips with ill-fitting tongues and grooves; a subfloor separated from the joists due to settling; or weakened joists that have dried out, rotted, or have faulty bridging. Because squeaks usually are caused by boards rubbing against each other, they can easily be silenced by lubricating or reattaching the boards.Locate the squeak by having someone walk over the noisy area of the floor while you listen and watch from below. Look for springy boards, movement between joists, and bridging that sags when weight is applied. As a precaution, inspect the area around the squeak for structural damage which may require the replacement of girders, posts, or bridging.The following six scenarios should help you troubleshoot and fix your squeaky floor.    1) Shimming the Subfloor Simple wood shims, wedged into gaps between a joist and loose subfloor boards, will stop all movement between the boards—and the squeaking it causes.a. Locate the squeak.b. Gently tap in shims to just fill the space between the joists and subfloor. Do not drive the shims too forcefully or they may further separate the boards from the joist and widen the gap you're trying to eliminate. A dab of adhesive on both sides of each shim will further anchor the boards.2) Cleating the SubfloorIf the squeak is caused by diagonally laid boards in the subfloor, you can eliminate movement of the boards with 1x4 or 1x6 cleats. a. Locate the squeaky boards.b. Place the cleat along the joist supporting the loose boards. Prop the cleat in place with a piece of 2x4 so it lies snugly against the joist and the subfloor.c. Using 8d nails, nail the cleat to the joist. Drive the nails while the cleat is firmly wedged into the right angle formed by the floor and the joist.d. Once the cleat is solidly attached, remove the 2x4 prop.   3) Bridging the Joists If you notice squeaking over a large area, the joists beneath the floor may be slightly shifting and inadequately supporting the subfloor. Stabilize the subfloor by attaching steel bridging between the joists, preventing them from moving side to side. a. Affix the first bridging. Hammer its straight-pronged end into the top of a joist. Drive its L-shaped, flanged end into the bottom of the opposite joist. The steel bridging should create tension between the opposing joists.b. Install companion bridging in a crisscross fashion.c. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for other joists, as needed. The result should be a series of firmly braced joists that are less likely to give beneath weight on the floor.  4) Installing Screws from Below When individual boards are loose or bulging, the resulting squeak can be fixed by tightening the boards with screws inserted from below. Use wood screws of a length that will penetrate the subfloor board but stop 1/4 inch below the surface of the finish floor. a. Drill a pilot hole into the subfloor the size of the screw shank. Put tape on the bit at 3/4 inch so you won't drill into the finish floor.b. Drill a pilot hole in the finish floor with a bit slightly smaller than that used for the subfloor. Tape the bit at 1-1/4 inches so you'll stop within 1/4 inch of the finished surface.c. Insert the screw through a large-diameter washer, and turn it into the hole. As you tighten the screw, it will bite into the finish floorboards and pull them down.  5) Nailing Through the Finish Floor. If you cannot gain access to the subfloor, straight nails can be driven through the finish floor to anchor loose boards. a. On hardwood floors, drill a pilot hole narrower than the nail to reduce the chance of spli <SEP> How do i stop floorboards creaking - they're covered with carpet?

Installing Vinyl Siding - Making It Simple by Colin McDougall Installing vinyl siding can be a very rewarding process that could dramatically change the appearance of your home. For the most part, if you plan your job well and adhere to some simple guide lines, anyone could learn how to install siding to there home. The first thing to consider when installing vinyl siding is what tools will be needed for the job. Basically with some common carpenter tools, like a, hammer, level, chalk line, screw driver set, tin snips and a good circular saw you can pretty much achieve what it is you need to do. But if you plan on making a profession out of it, expect to pay in the thousands for a properly equipped truck. After you have gathered your tools, you will need to collect your materials to prepare the job. Below you will find a list of some fundamental items needed to start your siding project. Sheathing/BackerboardVinyl siding should be applied over a sheathing that provides a smooth, flat surface. Since every district has different code requirements you may want to consult local building codes for sheathing requirements. Vinyl siding should never be applied directly to framing studs without sheathing. As an alternative to backer board, there is a variety of specific types of contoured foam under lays available for various styles of vinyl siding. Weather Resistant BarrierVinyl siding should be installed over a continuous weather resistant barrier to stop the intrusion of incidental water. Weather resistant barrier systems commonly consist of a combination of exterior cladding, flashed wall openings and penetrations, weather resistant barrier material, and sheathing. Commonly used is black carpentry felt. When using felt be sure to check thickness requirements. Flashing Code-compliant flashing should be integrated with the weather resistant barrier and applied around windows, doors, and other openings. Flashing should also be applied to inside and outside corners, and the intersection of walls and roofing to prevent water seepage through the joints. Once your outside wall has been covered with sheathing to provide a smooth flat surface, and your windows and doors have had flashing installed to channel any incidental water from collecting, you may now install the starter strip. This strip is an accessory applied directly to the surface of the building at the lowest part of the wall to be sided, and is used to secure the first course of siding to the home. This course will need to be checked for level as it is what the rest of the job relies upon for evenness. With aluminum, galvanized steel, or other corrosion-resistant nails, you may now start installing the vinyl siding. As each style of panel may be different refer to installation instructions supplied. Cut the panels to length with a circular saw and trim with tin snips. As you nail the panels in place, be sure to leave about the thickness of as dime between the nail head and wall to allow for shifting. Check every 5th or 6th course for horizontal alignment. When portions overlap you must have about 1" to seal the joint. The basic installation of vinyl siding is quite simple, but since there are codes governing how certain aspects are handled, you should inquire with a professional for specific trimming tasks and other more complicated vinyl siding installation practices. All in all, you will find the task of re-siding your home manageable with only a few frustrations to contend with. But the reward will be well worth it.

My wife and I moved from the US to Ireland.  Just before we came, my wife bought a water filter to use over here in Ireland.  It has several bits that allows it to be attached to different sized kitchen taps.  (It's the type of filter that sends water from the tap through the filter and out a separate spigot on the side.) But none of the connector bits fit into the kitchen tap we have here.  I went to a plumbing supply place in Dublin and was told there was nothing that could connect the two because US and European standards for plumbing fixtures are different.  Basically what I need is a doodad that screws onto my Irish kitchen type on one side and onto my US-made water filter on the other -- and forms a leakproof seal.  Any suggestions?
I have to assume you're talking about the thermostat that controls the oven heat.   Not knowing how old your unit is,  on most ranges the oven control knob will pull straight off the shaft and reveal the valve behind.   The opening of the range body will be just slightly larger than the valve shaft, so you will need a fairly small screwdriver, usually flat bladed, to possibly loosen a small screw and move a small lever or slide control on the side of the valve.  Don't move it much at a time, just a few degrees, then try the oven to see where the setting is .  You'll need a good oven thermometer to check. <SEP> how do i adjust the thermostat on an old gas range?
Great automotive questionBut that's a problem that's extremely difficult to solve, at least on a permanent basis.It's caused by the growth of fungi in the ac evaparator case, manufactuers have been faced with this complaint for years. Especially in geographic regions with high humidity and temperatures.There are numerous products on the market that propose to eliminate the odor, but I've never seen one that permanately resolves the smell. Usually they will work for a short period of time and the smell reappears.Most dealerships and some auto repair shops will have a chemical and special tool that is sprayed inside the evaporator core to slow down this fungi growth, and hopefully stop the smell.You may be able to purchase similar products at your local parts house as well, it should come with instructions on how to use.One Important tip--------Using your ac on outside air on a frequent basis will help slow down this condition to some degree. The outside air keeps moisture from building up in the evaporator case, thus preventing the growth of fungi.It will also help the evap case dry if you turn your ac mode on "outside air" before shutting off the engine for long periods of time.Jerry Christopherhttp://www.usedcarwise.com <SEP> How can I get rid of the musty smell coming out of my cars AC.?
not necessarily a short. What kind of truck is it??? There is a timer on the glow plugs telling them how long to stay on. If you are not familure with a glow plug set up it will be a lot beter to take it to someone who does. There are temp.sensors to tell them how warm the motor is and timers to tell how long to stay on. They can go out all at once because when one blows the rest fowwows behind it quickly taking too much power tring to make up from the bad one etc.sometimes the timers will go out making the plugs stay on partially all the time.

Steps:  1.   Determine that a dead battery is the reason your car is not starting. If the engine cranks when you turn the key, the problem is not the battery and jump-starting won't help. If the windshield wipers, lights and heater blower all work, the battery is probably fine and you may have a bad starter. A jump-start won't help if you have a bad starter. If you hear no sound at all when you turn the key or if the engine cranks very slowly and the accessories do not work, then you have a dead or low battery and it's time to break out the jumper cables. You'll need a flashlight if it's dark outside.    2.   Find someone with a running car that can give yours a jump.    3.   Open the hoods on both cars and determine where the batteries are. Park the booster car (the one that's running) so that the batteries are adjacent.   4.   Turn off the booster car.    5.   Attach the red jumper cable's end to the positive terminal on the dead battery. Use a rag to wipe the battery clean if you can't see the Pos or plus (+) sign on the battery. The positive terminal is always slightly larger than the negative one.    6.   Attach the other end of the red cable to the booster battery's positive terminal.    7.   Attach the black jumper cable's end to the booster battery's negative terminal.    8.   Attach the other end of the black jumper cable to a ground on the dead car's engine; any solid metal part works fine. You may see a small spark when you attach the last end. This is normal.   9.   Turn on the booster car and rev the engine.    10.   Turn on the dead car. If it doesn't start, you may have a poor connection at any of the four cable ends. Jiggle each cable end and try starting the car again.  It may take a bit of letting the car sit while the dead battery builds a small charge.    11.   Once the car starts, disconnect the cables in reverse order of attachment: negative, negative, positive, positive.    12.   Keep the engine running on the jumped car for at least 20 minutes or longer so the alternator has sufficient time to recharge your battery.         Overall Tips:   Always store a set of jumper cables in the trunk of your car.     Holding up jumper cables indicates clearly to passing motorists that you need a jump--but stay safely out of the road when you do so.     When buying jumper cables, choose a set that is at least 8 feet (2.5 m) long; this makes it easier to connect the two cars.       Overall Warnings:   Do not reverse the polarity. Make sure the cables are attached as described, to avoid damaging your car's electrical equipment or causing the battery to explode. <SEP> how do you hook up battery cables?

Tools required: flashlight, phillips screwdriver, maybe wire cutters#1  TURN OFF YOU POWER AT THE FUSE BOX!!!!!!!!!#2  Remove old plate (should be really easy since the screws are missing!)#3  There should be 2 or possible 3 screws in the "guts" part of the switch.  One is silver, one is gold and might have one that is green.#4  Undo these screws and remove all of the parts to the old switch.  You should be left with 2 or 3 wires sticking out of the wall.#5 Install the new switch by attaching the white wire to the silver screw, black wire to the gold screw and green wire to the green screw - do not be alarmed if there is no green screw, this is only the ground wire and isn't required to have it function. (most old houses will not have them.)EASY TIP - you should already have the wires ready to attach to the new hardware, but if the wires are in bad condition (the individual copper wires are broken) you will need a set of wire cutters (they look like plyers) Cut the entire wire off as close to the end as you can while still removeing the damaged section.  Cut the colored plastic about 1/4 inch from the end and remove only the plastic section (do not cut the wires too)  Take the bundle of copper wires and twist them clockwise.  Place the bundle of twisted wires between the appropriate screw and the metal plate behind the screw.  Tighten the screw.  Repeate for the remaining wires.#6 Install the new plate on the outside of the switch#7 Turn the power back on & enjoy your handy work!It sounds like a lot but it only takes about 10 minutes!Good luck and if in doubt have a friend watch you do it to help talk you through the steps.Please e-mail me if you need clearification! <SEP> How do I change a 3-way light switch out in a bathroom for a more updated look?

The piece of plastic that is the width of the car, is an air deflector and has to be removed to get at the 2 retainers that hold the headlamp in place. I use a pair of side wire cutters to remove the nail shaped plugs. If you do wreck the plugs, you can get them at any automotive parts store or your G.M. dealer which are pretty inexpensive. Should only be couple of dollars for all the plugs. Next you will notice two black retainers at the back of each headlamp assembly after the black air deflector is removed. Lift up or pull up on these 2 retainers to disengage the headlamp assembly and then pull the headlamp straight forward from the headlamp mounting panel. Remember to not touch the glass of the NEW bulb with your finger tips because the oil on your fingertips will cause the bulb to burn out prematurely. I hope this will help you. <SEP> How do I replace the headlights on a 2005 Grand Am? The manual states that the headlight assembly must be tilted up and forward out of the front of the car before there will be any access to the rear side of the assembly to twist and remove the bulbs. The issue is removing the assembly in the first place -- the manual indicates that there is a snap in piece of plastic locking the entire assembly in place, but the actual car does not match the images in the manual, and there is a large piece of plastic which spans the entire width of the car. This piece of plastic appears to be secured with plastic nail-shaped plugs that don't seem to want to come out without being broken (probably single-usage snaps meant to be replaced). Do you know how to remove the assembly in the first place to access the rear side of it?

A battery does not produce energy. It stores electricity chemically in its cells. The Alternator produces electricity when your car is running to keep the battery charged for starting the car and to run the electrical devices of your car.

This measures the voltage of the battery to see if it maintains good voltage under a large amperage electrical load. <SEP> How does a car battery actually produces electricity.

Try to determine what function (tail light, radio, etc.) is affected.  Also try to determine which fuse is blown.  From both ends of the problem you may be able to identify if any special wire insulation color is involved.  This may permit a visual trace to find a problem, including charred wires.  Also check the owners manual (or a more complete manual that you may find at a large public library) to determine what loads share a given fuse or wiring connection.  Manuals often include complete wiring diagrams and sometimes troubleshooting tips.  One wire say to a tail light should lead to ground while the other wire (at its terminal near the light) should not be grounded with the switch off and the bulb removed.  You can use a voltmeter and an ohmmeter to check for faults if you know what you are looking for.  Good luck. <SEP> How do I find a short in my jeep wire?
The problem with any of the household soaps is they are made to attack grease, etc. and other substances and break it down. Which means any type of dish/laundry soap will attack the finish (shine) on your paint. Ever see a car with the clear coat gone bad? The owner probably used Joy dish soap time after time. I suppose a very light dose of a baby shampoo just enough to get suds wouldn`t do too much harm, but keep it light. On the interior rugs and uphol. again a very light watered down dish or laundry soap for dirt would be OK, use a brush and `rinse` with clear water. The dash and hard plastic parts (tires) maybe just a damp cloth to clean away dirt, and a very light coat of Pledge-type product? After applying wipe with dry clean cloth. It may however attract dust and remain greasy feeling, haven`t tried that one.

In every vehicle there are 2 parts to the cooling system. Whats in the radiator and whats in the engine block. The thermostat sits between them. when you start you car your engine warms up and the coolant in the engine block gets hot. when it reaches the right temperature the thermostat starts to open allowing some of the cold water from the radiator to circulate round the engine. That's how the system works. So for a really simple test, start your car from cold and wait 10 minutes. If the top of the radiator is hot then you know that the coolant is circulating and your thermostat works. If its cold then you have a problem. Good luck <SEP> how do you know if your cars themostat is working correctly? engine is not overheating but seems to put off alot of heat is this normal

The heater is probley electric so I would first check the fuse/circuit breaker box to see if the fuse/circuit breaker is tripped. If the fuse box is okay then you will need to access the heater and open the panel there the electric wires coming in. Using a amp meter, test to see if amprage is being drawn through the wires to the heating element. If no amp's are being drawn then the element is possibly burnt out. However the tempature control circuit may not be sending a signal to the control relay to turn on the element. Check the tempature control circuit board to see the thermocouple is connected and the boards output relay is energized using a volt meter. If there is no voltage output from the circuit board to the heater element then the tempature control circuit board is faulty. It has been by experience that if the tub is drained and the heater is left "on", the heater element burns out because the element doesn't have any water around it to keep it at normal tempature. Some tubes also have a sensor that detects when no water is present and shuts down the power to the element. This sensor circuit may also be faulty so if you replace the element it still may burn out. Have a qualified service tech thoughly check out the system, it's worth the money and a warranty on the work. <SEP> how can I determine why  my hydrojet water heater is not working?
There are lots of functions on a VOM, but you will use the AC and DC voltage, ohm, and continuity funtctions most often.  The voltage funtions will tell you if a part is getting power and what that voltage is.  The Ohm funtions tell you the reistance of sensors or other aparts and let you know if there in spec or need repalced.  The continuity funtion simple tells you if the wire or part between the probes is letting current pass through it.  REMEMBER NEVER TEST THE RESISTANCE OR CONTINUITY OF A LIVE CIRCUIT!!  You might just blow a fuse in the meter or blow the whole meter up in your hand!!  Many meters now have temp probes and can help you find problems with dryer air flow or heating elements.  There's not enough time or space here to tell you how to test all the parts or diagnose problems in appliances with your meter, but I would suggest investing in 2 books to help you out.  The first is a simple VOM how to book you can get at Radio Shack and the other would be one of the Time Life type of repair how to books that include appliances.  Both of these books will teach you most ways to use your VOM to diagnose problems and then repair what you find.

lift the vehicle in the rear and put the rear end on jack stands.  remove the cover on the rear differential. make sure there is a drain pan under it because it will make a mess.  once the cover is removed rotate the ring gear around(the transmission will have to be in neutral) until you see a 5/16" bolt in the side of the carrier assembly from the passenger side of the vehicle. remove that bolt(it will be very tight).  once the bolt is removed the center pin will slide out of the carrier assembly.  make sure the tire and brake drum are removed from the side you want to change.  push the axle on the desired side in. now that the center pin is removed the axle will move inward and there is a horse shoe shaped clip that will fall off of the end of the axle and the spider gear.  the axle is then free to be removed.  reverse procedure to install.

The white is a neutral wire and goes to the 4 other white wires. It may be hard to find a wirenut big enough to fit 5 wires into one wirenut.

Sounds like the idle mixture screws then.There are two screws on the base of the carb. Typically on the front. While the engine is running, screw one of them in (turn clockwise) one half turn at a time. Count the half turns. Keep turning until the engine starts to run rough. Back it off a half turn.Do this for the other screw. Then go back to the first and using quarter turns, turn clockwise and then back off when the engine runs rough. Do this for the other screw.Should be set fine now.You could also turn both screws all the way in, and then back off one and one half turns. Then start the engine and try quarter turns as explained above.Count the number of turns it took for each screw to tighten. Don't tighten too much. If worse comes to worse and the engine is running like a dog, put them back to where you started. And try again. <SEP> How do you adjust the carburetor on a 82 ford 4wd pu 460 motor  with a holly carb?
A good carpenter (framing,finish,siding) should be able to furnish you with references or a portfolio of their previous work.Don't be afraid to ask questions.Be sure to discuss ALL aspects of job to be preformed.If you add EXTRAS after the job has started they will cost you more than if you discussed them beforehand.As far as finding a GOOD carpenter take a ride around town and look for any projects currently being done.Stop and talk to some of sub-contractors even if their not carpenters.These guys all work on the same projects.The best guy to talk to is a finish carpenter he's the one who has to follow behind the framer.If the framing is well done it makes his job alot easier.By the way as far as giving him a drink as referred to above I've been a carpenter for 21 yrs. and I don't drink we're not all drunks that's stereotyping <SEP> How to Hire a Framing Carpenter  ?

There is no known flexible chimney liner that I would recommend if you are burning wood, a chimney fire can reach 1700-2000 degrees. Only rigid ceramic or thick SS can stand up to that.

Open your tank (water closet) top.Take the hose that goes into the long tube and clip it to the outside of that same tube.  Not only will the bowl level lower, you will use less water per flush. For real water savings - though may cause too little water per flush to rid bowl of a large bowel movement and require a second flush on occasion - take a ziplock bag, fill with water, place in the water closet out of the way of any moving parts.  Usually just to the left (or right) of the flush handle.  This causes an ongoing displacement of water  that is never used.  You save the ziplock full of water on every flush.  The later method alone will not lower the outer bowl level.  I just through that one in for conservation and cost savings.  Enjoy! <SEP> how can I do-it-myself to lower the water in the toilet bowl?

Usually the check engine light comes on when there is a malfunction present. Best thing to do is plug in an OBDII Scanner (if you have one) to see whats wrong with the vehicle (if anything). I know most Advance Auto Parts & Auto Zones will do this for free. Swing in & tell then your check engine light is on. They should be able to tell you why its on & turn it off for you unless there is an active issue that requires repair & will only turn the light back on. Forgot to mention, Disconnecting the battery for a few minutes & reconnecting should also turn it off. It will come back on if there is an issue that requires repair as stated above. Best bet is to get it checked out. <SEP> how do you turn off or reset a engine check light on a 2003 dodge durango?

R-134a uses a different fitting and a different set of guages to properly charge your system. The 134 guages are calibrated different from the old R-12 guages. This does not mean you can't use your R-12 guages (assuming you have any) you just have to know what the pressure differential is. Adapters can be purchased to fit the fittings on your car. The color of the cap is irrelevant, that is just a GM thing. You did not mention whether the fitting was on the liquid line (small line) or suction side (large line), I will assume it is the suction side for now. GM and other manufacturers have moved the other fitting closer to the AC compressor, look where the lines come off the compressor, especially underneath on the bottom, you will likely find the fitting there.

Remove the inner tube, by removing the wheel from the bicycle. Ensure the inner tube is fully deflated by pressing on the pin inside the valve. Remove the inner tube from the tyres using tyres levers failing that spoon handles also work well. Never use anything sharp. Try to determine the cause if the puncture. There may be a thorn or piece of glass embedded in the tyre. Run your hand gently inside the tyre to check if there is something sharp. Remove if you find this with say a screwdriver. Alternatively check if a spoke is pushing through, ensure the tape inside the rim is sitting properly. Inflate the tyre using a pump and fill a bowl with water and check if any bubbles escape. If they are escaping from teh valve you will need a new inner tube. If however they are escaping from a hole in the rubber remove the inner tube and dry this area, deflate the inner tube. In your bicycle repair kit you will have a tube of rubber solution and a piece of rubber. Spread rubber solution on the area around the hole with rubber solution covering an area just wider than the rubber patch. Leave about 5minutes to dry. Check the rubber solution should be tacky. Peel off the backing of your rubber strip and apply that previously coated side to the rubber solution. To avoid air bubbles forming press from the center outwards. Once satisfied, grate and dust some chalk powder to prevent any extra rubber solution to sticking to your tyre. Leave another few minutes before gently pumping up the inner tube again about half pressure. Check the hole is now fixed by placing under water again. If all is well then deflate position carefully inside the tyre and inflate to full pressure. Replace and tighten the wheel. You should now be ready to ride again. <SEP> How do you repair a bicycle puncture? I have all the tools and a spare inner tube just in case but have only got as far as taking my wheel off!

If you used an oil base stain you can use an oil based top coat or a water base top coat. Look for "Gloss" on the can.please note: wait ATLEAST 24 hours to apply a water base top coat to an oil based stain!If you used a water based stain, ONLY use a water based top coat!!Generally, 3 coats of a top coat will do a great job in "sealing" your project. Remember to sand in between coats with 400 to 600 gritt sand paper (after the top coat has dried).

Loosen the lugs first. Jack up the car and place it on jackstands for safety.  Remove the lugnuts and the wheel.  Unbolt the caliper and brake hose retaining bolts.  Remove the caliper, do not allow it to hang from the brake hose (I use a bungee cord and hang it from the spring).  Remove the brake pads if they didn't come out with the caliper.  The brake rotor will now come off easily, if not lightly tap it with a rubber mallet.  Reassemble in reverse order, being sure to clinch the tabs on the brake pads if so equipped, and be sure the anti-rattle clips are in place on the back of the pads.  I use an anti-squeal product on the back of the new pads.  Be sure to torque the caliper bolts to the proper specification.  Once the wheel is on the ground, re-torque the lugnuts to the proper spec as well.  Take the rotor to an auto parts store for thickness measurement, if too thin replace with a new one as a thin one will break.  If thickness is ok, have the old rotor turned (surfaced) if severely scratched or gouged.  I change my pads about every 30K miles before the rotors get damaged.  Oh, you will have to push the caliper pistons back into the caliper with a 'C' clamp before re-installing the caliper on new pads. <SEP> how do you replace a brake rotor?

Depends on what the application and how many lines.  If it is a single line - analog phone system (such as those found in the home) - just connect green to white and red to white w/blue.  This is the standard pairing for a phone.

Use an everyday spray bottle and spray water on the popcorn.  Start in a small section in the most hidden corner of the room becasue there is a slight learning curve to this.  Once you spray and saturate the popcorn, use a putty knife (1" in detail areas, up to 6" in large areas) and attempt to scrape off the popcorn.  DO NOT OVERWET OR OVERSCRAPE AT FIRST! Start with minimal water and scraping and increase from there.  The goal is to scrape off the texture (popcorn) and not the drywall paper (if it is in fact drywall behind it, some older homes may have a different backing than drywall). Make sure you wear eye protection and something to prevent you from inhaling the dust and/or particles.  This is a VERY messy process, so make sure you cover everything below with a heavy plastic drop-cloth, which can be purchased at any home improvement store. <SEP> how to remove popcorn ceiling?

Am wondering why you replaced your battery and alternator in the first place. Need more details. Is your alarm a factory unit or aftermarket? Did you replace the parts because your car wouldnt start in the first place? A quick check to see if your battery is charged ....have someone stand in front of your car....turn your headlights on....turn the ignition switch to start....see if the headlights dim. If they dim then the battery doesnt have enough current to start the car. Alarms come wired in many different options.

Well, I guess by the sounds of people here, I'm a rarity. I'm honest and good. I have never ripped a single person off and I now teach it at our local community college. The best advice is to be upfront with them. If you don't like their personality, go somewhere else. You really need to go in person to meet them, as often we are to busy to talk on the phone and are constantly bothered by price shoppers. it's just like finding a doctor you like. Sometimes you have to go to several of them to find one that your personalities mesh with. Once you find one, reward them with your loyalty. A good customer/provider relationship benefits both parties. We know your history of the car and you know we won't rip you off. We'll also know if we need to call you when repairs get expensive or if you are the type who doesn't need a phone call. Hope this helps. All you can do is try and see. Ask friends for local recomendations. In our area, dealers are the rip-offs, but in my parents area , it's the opposite. The independants are.

The dimming circuit for the mirror works on the principle of differential - i.e. if the light coming at the mirror from the rear of the car as detected by a sensor on the face of the mirror is significantly brighter then the light striking the back of the mirror as detected by a photo sensor on the backside of the mirror, the circuit energizs the electrochromic surfce in the mirror (or, on older models, activates a motor that physically tilts the mirror).A quick check - there should be a small hole in the face of the mirror, and a sensor on the rear - are they covered by hanging objects?Also - is the mirror dirty?

With difficulty.The official access mentioned in the handbook is via a removable panel in the front wheel-arch liner. It will make more sense if you look at the diagrams in the handbook before starting.Put the steering on almost full lock towards the opposite side from the indicator you need to access (not quite full lock, switching the engine off on full lock can cause problems with the electric steering lock disengagement next time you try to start).This allows you to see the oval-shaped access panel, which slides to one side and removes.Carefully reach through the hole left by removing the access panel, locate the rear of the indicator bulb-holder, and carefully twist to remove. It should now be possible to bring the bulb-holder out through the access hole to change the bulb.I believe most dealers actually don't use this method, and instead remove the whole headlamp unit forwards, but I think this requires removal of some of the fastenings for the front bumper fascia.Have a read of some of the articles on the owners forum for more details http://www.meganeownersclub.co.uk/ <SEP> how do i change the front indicator bulb on a 2005 renault megane?

When Good Transmissions Go Bad By Heather Madigan & Carolyn MartellCarPrices.com  The word transmission conjures up dread, perhaps even fear. Especially when your mechanic starts to utter, "I think your transmission is . . ." Your brain is attacked violently by the image of your checkbook being sucked empty by a greedy vacuum. The money you had been saving to go on vacation, or to buy that new computer, ultimately will dwindle to nothing now that there is something wrong with your transmission.Instead of having to succumb every ounce of your savings to a mechanic, maybe you can diffuse some transmission problems before they set in. The solution is called preventive maintenance, and it comes highly recommended by manufacturers, dealers, mechanics and generally everybody who has a car or knows about them.The damage done to a transmission can be catastrophic to your lifestyle, at best. For one thing, while your car sits in the shop, you must get a ride wherever you want to go -- Grrr! And then there's that little matter of money: Rebuilding a transmission is estimated at around $2,150. That's some pretty major incentive to try to maintain the transmission as best you can.The basics are a good place to start. The transmission propels the car forward. It is a mechanism that transfers the power produced by the engine, ultimately to spin the wheels of the vehicle. The transmission operates under tremendous heat, therefore it is vital that the fluids are maintained and that extra caution is taken when driving in extreme conditions, such as harsh winter weather or hauling heavy loads. The transmission, however, can overheat by normal driving, pushing the fluid temperatures well beyond safe limits.According to the Automatic Transmission Rebuilds Association, overheating causes 90 percent of all transmission failures. Most of these can be blamed on worn-out fluid that should have been replaced. Check your transmission fluid level regularly, and actually smell it to find out if it has a burnt odor. If it does smell burnt, it needs to be changed. Refer to your car manual to find out specific mileage/time intervals to check and change the fluid, which varies from car to car. Every 30,000 to 50,000 miles is a good number to keep in mind. Performing this sooner will not hurt anything though.If there is a reddish leak under your vehicle, this could spell bad news. It's usually the automatic transmission fluid. It is vital at this point to check the fluid level more frequently. Whatever you do, do not allow that fluid to run low! The transmission will heat up, breaking down the fluid's ability to lubricate and cool. This will increase friction and heat, which will wear out the transmission prematurely. Use the transmission fluid that is recommended in the car manual or printed on the dipstick. Using the wrong type of fluid can affect the way the transmission shifts and feels, causing it to shift too harshly or slip under heavy loads.Getting the vehicle stuck in mud or snow can cause another potential hazard to the transmission -- as well as the whole vehicle, seeing as how it is stuck somewhere. It always is suggested that you dig your vehicle out or get towed vs. the alternative. And at one time or another, we all have seen -- or perhaps resorted to -- the jump-on-the-bumper method to gain traction to rock the vehicle free. This can shock the transmission more than it can handle, and internal parts can start to break.The life of any automobile is extended when it is taken care of properly. So, what if you do change the fluids and keep up on the fluid levels, and it still overheats? Remember, this is a machine and machines break. Do what you can to keep your transmission in good health by performing regularly scheduled maintenance checks. There isn't much more you can do other than hiding the vehicle in the garage, and that's no fun! <SEP> How to tell if your vehicles transmission is bad? I have a 1993 nissan pathfinder

2, 4, 8, 16 .....Alternator Secrets Created 01/15/00 Anozira Updated 02/04/02 http://members.1stconnect.com/anozira ALTERNATOR SECRETSAUTHOR UNKNOWN - DATE UNKNOWN INTRODUCTIONIn the last two decades alternators have replaced generators in motor vehicles. The reasons are many: output current can be produced at lower rpm, voltage can be more accurately' controlled with solid state regulators, alternators need less maintenance, and they cost less to manufacture.When modified, auto alternators can provide variable direct current at 0 to 120 volts for battery charging, hot charging, light arc welding, or for running AC-DC appliances and lights. Another simple modification provides AC power to run some transformer-operated appliances. If you know the secrets of its operation and the modifications possible, the small low-cost alternator can become a versatile power plant.BASIC CONSTRUCTIONThe old-fashioned generator contains a wound stater which produces a constant magnetic field in which a revolving coil of wire, called an armature, turns. A commutator on one end of the armature made up of many individual brass segments passes the generated current to the outside world through carbon brushes.Because commutator segments must be electrically insulated from one another, they can not be fabricated from a single -block of metal. Each commutator segment must be individually attached to the armature shaft. This is a source of mechanical weakness. When the armature is rotated at high RPM, centrifugal force can cause the commutator to explode, throwing segments in all directions.To prevent explosions, the generator is usually driven at less than engine speed. An auto engine may turn 5000 RPM, but the generator must be geared to a maximum 2500 rpm for safety's sake. As a result, the generator turns so slowly at low engine rpm that it produces little or no current. A modern alternator, like the generator, contains both moving and stationary coils of wire. In the alternator, however, the moving coil, called the rotor, uses current supplied through slip rings to generate a moving field. Power is extracted from the stationary field coils.Slip rings replace the weak generator commutator. The rotor coils themselves are encased in a strong soft iron shell making the whole assembly much stronger than the generator armature. The net result is that alternators can be driven to much higher speeds without danger of explosion. In fact, alternators are usually driven at up to twice engine speed some running at 8000 rpm or more. At low engine rpm the geared up alternator turns much faster than a comparable geared down generator. The net result is that the alternator can begin producing useful charging current at lower engine rpm than can the generator. A coil of wire rotating in a magnetic field produces an alternating current with a frequency dependent on how fast the coil turns, one cycle being produced per revolution. A generator armature uses a commutator to mechanically switch rotating windings in and out of automobile's electrical system to produce direct current.The three separate stationary windings of the typical auto alternator produce three-phase alternating current. Rather than use a commutator to mechanically convert AC to DC, the alternator uses six diodes in a full-wave bridge rectifier circuit. In essence the diodes are solid state switches with no moving parts, making them maintenance-free and explosion proof.The alternator output voltage can be controlled or regulated by varying the rotor current. Regulators sample the output voltage and automatically change the intensity of the rotating magnetic field by adjusting the current fed to the rotor through the slip rings. The adjustments are made in such a way so as to bring the output voltage to the desired level.THREE-PHASE POWERSurprisingly, alternators are constructed with three sets of field wi <SEP> how do you tell how many poles a altenator has?

1st soak the nut with any penetrate solvent such as WD40, Liquid Wrench or PB Blaster. These are available at any auto parts store. While the nut is soaking with the penetrate tap the nut vibration will allow additional penetrate into the threads to help loosen them.2nd. Try loosening the nut again while tapping the nut.If this does not come loose you might want to try a little heat, with a propane torch. IF YOU DO USE THE HEAT MAKE SURE YOU REMOVED THE PENETRATE AND WASHED ALL THE SURFACES. THE PENETRATES ARE EXTREMELY FLAMMABLE.REMEMBER: Righty an tighty. Lefty a loosey.

Pressure regulators are factory set for 50 psi. You can increase the pressure by backing off the lock nut, then turning the screw in. You should really to a pressure test on an outside line first to determine if you have enough pressure coming from the meter. Look to see if there is a tee in the incoming water line before the water shutoff and regulator. If there is, that line is going to a hose bib ( spigot ) to the outside of the house. That will give you a real pressure reading from the meter. Pressure testers are available at Home Depot, etc. and just attach to the spigot like a hose. Turn on the water and get the reading. If you can change the water pressure be careful . If you have a spigot at some other location around the house, it will be the water pressure after the regulator. Check it as you increase the pressure. I wouldn't go above 65 or 70 psi. If that doesn't do it, your water pressure in the lines isn't the problem. <SEP> How can you increase water pressure in a house? I already had a pressure regulater installed and that didn't help...

So have you decided to lift the bed rather than drop the tank? It's not real hard.There should be electrical connectors that run to the brake lights, the harness may or may not attach to the bed, it usually runs along the frame rail.

Hi Kelly there are two parts to the answer to your question. The first part is how to do it and what tools are needed. That answer is here. http://www.rldassociates.com/zx2/howto/belt.htmThe second part is why does it keep coming off. The answer to this is trickier. Serpentine belts must be very carefully aligned. Even an eighth of an inch out of alignment can cause the belt to slip off or fail prematurely. Once the belt is installed you must be sure that the two idler pulleys and the belt pretensioner pully (see diagram at URL above) are exactly in line. One way to do this, if you have a good eye is to sight down the edge of the belt from several angles to be sure that all of the edges match. If they don't you will need to adjust one or more of the pulleys. Another, more accurate way is to place a straight edge (a metal yardstick would be perfect, but a piece of pipe or angle iron could be used too, against the edges of the belt to be sure that all of them are perfectly in line. If everything is lined up and the belt is properly tensioned that should take care of your problem permanently. If it doesn't, the pretensioner is probably either worn out or out of adjustment. Ford uses nylon spacers in the pretensioner and they can become brittle and fail because of age and the heat in the engine compartment. Good luck with this. I hope it helps. It's a job with some challenges because of how difficult it is to get at all of the twists and turns of the belt. <SEP> How do I replace a serpentine belt that has slipped on a 98 Ford Escort Zx2?

When you ran out of gas, it is highly likely that the fuel pump sucked something into it that was sitting in your gas tank and either damaged your fuel pump, or clogged the filter if you've got a fuel pump inside the tank.If your fuel pump is out side the tank.

Hopefully the filter prevented the junk from the tank from moving further down.If your fuel pump is inside the tank, try a bottle of fuel injector cleaner down the tank.

1. Inspect the black rubber cover that fits in the disposal. Sometimes bits of garbage collect under the flaps and create a smell.    2. Clean the rubber cover, if necessary.

If you have already removed the pipe to clean it, then there is another clog further in the line, Drano foam is the best product I have used, if you feel there my be more organtic material as the clog there is Drano Power for organic material as well. Although these products are not cheap, they are the best, and they are a lot cheaper than calling a plumber, if however, you have old lines they may have cracked and pieces of the line are blocking the flow, in this case lines have to be replaced, go with PVC if this needs to be done, it is around .75 a foot and lasts years longer than any other material, slick on the inside so having clogs will not appear unless large amounts of something is rinsed down the drain. <SEP> How do I unplugg my bathroom sink?

As long as the power consumption of the fixture is not too high, like upto 200 watts, you just need to change the plug, the light bulbs to 110V type, and no need to change the wiring.  Normally, a 200 watt fixture running at 220V draws exactly 200/220 or less than 1 ampere.  So, if you power your fixture to 200 watts at 110 volts, the current will be 200/110 which is less than 2 amperes.  Normally they use a #16 or #14 wires in the fixtures...so, I think that should be okay.  Summary:  1) Change plug to North American standard  2) Change the light bulbs to 110v type... maybe you could get a lesser wattage to draw lesser current  3) Optional: Change wiring to #14.Good luck <SEP> How do I change a lamp from 220 V to 110 V?

Head to Auto Zone or a similar auto parts place. They make a filler that stops the spidering of your windshield, and fills the glass so you can hardly tell it's there.

Earlier answers have this question just about nailed down.  I'll add this:   in most houses, especially ones where there was inadequate soffit vents, there is the insulation issue (in the attic) to contend with.   Grab a smaller sized light-weight rake and bring it up into the attic with you.  Pull any excess insulation away from where your new soffit vents will be letting cooler air into your attic.They also sell platic inserts that you can place on top of the insulation to hold it back and retain your air flow.While your up there, you can assess the amount of air flow that you have from the top of your roof.

I would advise against using brushes unless you practice the utmost care because of the potential for dirt lodged in the bristles, or the bristles itself, to marr the paint.  If you're interested in foam, I would strongly recommend using a Gilmour foam gun (you'll find 5 dollar ones at Wal-mart, but they're more like mixers rather than aerating foamers) in conjunction with a sheepskin wash mitt or a hydrophillic sponge (aka a grout spone, it may sound a bit unorthodox, but when they're wet, they're amazingly soft and less likely to trap dirt and cause marring).Anyways, good luck. <SEP> How could i put together a portable foaming brush system like you would find in a car wash?

You must have ventilation,  and if you have trapped air in the shed you won't stop the problem.

Shallow scratches can be hidden by using a leather conditioner.  Deeper scratches can only be fixed by a pro($79.00 -89.00), they have the kits that will fill in and blend the color.

If there are no screws (but I'm sure there are at least a couple) then the only thing holding the door panel on are a series of plastic pieces that snap into holes in the metal door panel. Make sure you look in the door handle recesses and if the vehicle has power windows you may have to pop out the switch panel cause they hide screws in these locations pretty often. Ford hides their screws in hidden locations. Start someplace on the door and get under the plastic outer panel. Using a light look inside the door and find one of these plastic pieces and pry up on it. It will pop out without too much trouble. Work your way around the door.

if the crack is no larger than a 1/4 inch wide and a few feet long, you can get concrete patch in a tube like silicoln caulk that you can apply directly in the crack after any debris is removed.  if it is over 1/4 but less than 1/2 then you might need to go with the quickrete that comes in a tub for better consistencey and trowel it in.  if it is over 1/2 you may want to get a contractor in to make sure there isnt a more serious problem of excessive settling caused by the foundation getting undermined by an underground stream or something. <SEP> how to repair a concrete foundation crack?
The local utility co. must provide power at the nominal voltages you mentioned , plus or or minus a few V.They should be able to give you a history of fluctuations in your area.If you can DIY , check the voltage at the service inlet (line side of breakers)If you measure fluctuations there , It is on the power company side.If Voltage is steady on line side, check  load side of each breaker individually & see if you get fluctuations.If  it is steady there ,check your outlets individually.See if the power company will do  a survey for you.Good luckTo be safe, best to have an electrician chase down the problem in the house if power company is not the source.Good luck.Bet its the power company. <SEP> How to stop constant  fluctuations in voltage at home?

Likely... the gas is already off if you;ve extinguished the fire and removed the logs,etc.  You don't smell or hear gas do you?So the gas is off.  If you are wanting to turn it off further upstream, there may or may not be a valve for doing so somewhere in your basement along the wall where your fireplace is.  Look for the (usually) black gas supply pipe.I personally wouldn't bother to do this.  The valve that you use that is on your fireplace is sufficient.  The one in your basement that hasn't been used is probably a tad brittle and you'll risk damage to it.  I recently broke a handle off of a shut-off valuve while replacing a hot water tank and then had the joy of turning off the outside valve to the house and replacing the broken shut-off valve.  Re-lighting pilot lites here and there. etc. etc. <SEP> How to turn off a gas fireplace? I have a gas fireplace and since it's summer I want to turn the gas off to it.

There are 3 buttons- press and hold the 2 outer ones until the light flashes rapidly- let go. Now, each button, as pressed, should have a slow flash.  If so, press and hold the desired button you want your opener on and the garage remote together until the light goes from the slow flash to the rapid flash (may take 1 minute). If you let go of either button before it flashes rapidly you have to start over. To add more remotes just repeat steps for the other two buttons. IF your opener has rolling code technology you will have to do another step. email me if so. <SEP> how do I program the garage remote control in my 2000 GMC Yukon?

Wrap the leaking joint with DENZO tape available at good plumbers merchants. <SEP> How do I fix a toilet leak? I have a slow water leak from a toilet where the toilet links to the main waste pipe in the wall of my flat.  The plumber who installed it appears to have sealed the connection with cement, which is starting to erode.  I've tried putting putty on it, but that doesn't help.  Because the current seal is slightly wet, I can't work out if there is any ideal sealant to use on a wet surface.  Does anyone have any ideas?
You can get a race puller from auto zone for only a deposit until you bring it back. With aluminum that's the only way I know to get it out without using heat.

Use a good utility knife to cut a square around the hole.  Make sure you cut all the way to the studs of the wall. Also you need to cut, NOT PAST YOUR STUD, which is One inch and a half, but you need to cut your drywall past the begining of the stud half of that which is 3/4 of an inch on both sides.   Keep your cuts as straight as possible to make a good square.  Find yourself a peice of drywall big enough to fill in the square you just made.  Place it in.  Nail or screw the peice to the studs you exposed.  Tape it, mud it, sand it, and paint over it. <SEP> HOw do you fix a large hole in drywall?
I am actually almost certain it has to do with people who view your page because I was thinking about this and conducted a little experiment (it's kinda confusing but bear with me).  I started off by typing every letter of the alphabet and seeing who came up on the search. So for example, I typed "A" and saw who came up. I noticed that the list of people were not necessarily in alphabetical order, but the people at the top were certainly my closest friends whose pages I visit all the time.  Then I thought maybe Facebook sets the search bar up conveniently for you to find the people you visit the most. But then I saw something strange, the girl that I just added was actually the second person in the "L" list, the first being my best friend, so that seemed odd to me.  So then I started thinking that it might actually have to do with the people who visit your page. To test the theory, I went to my "C" list, where the top two people were actually pretty much equal in terms of how many times I've visited their page and I assume they've visited mine. I went to the second person in the "C" list and clicked on their page a lot, refreshed it a few good times. Then I went back and searched "C" and sure enough, it was now the second friend whose page I had been refreshing who showed up first . I knew that this second friend was camping and had no Facebook/no way of looking at my page.  Now here's the real kicker: I told my other friend in the "C" list, the one who used to be first when I searched "C" to go on my page a couple of times. She did. I then took a couple of minutes and searched "C" again, and guess who came up first?  That's right, the girl who had just searched my page, despite the fact that I had been looking up the other girl's page recently.  Does this really prove that the Facebook search bar operates on people who have viewed your profile? Maybe, but it could also prove that I have WAY too much time on my hands. <SEP> How does Facebook guess results when you search for someone?
The Tps is located on the throttle body and is located on the end of the throttle shaft. Get a Haynes manual for your vehicle.

Last week the "check engine" light lit up in my 1998 mitsubishi mirage DS. I was concerned so I took it to a couple of auto zones (just to be sure) so they can check it, what they told me is that the Throttle Position Sensor (TPS) needed to be changed. I would like to change it myself, but I would like to know if it's difficult to do so, and some info (preferible an image) on where is the sensor located, and the position it needs to be put in. Also, do i need to adjust the TPS so the computer knows when the engine is at idling and when it's WOT?Thanks so much in advance...
