What sjaquay5708 the maintenance tech said is right on. You've got to find the source, first. He named the most common -- toilet fill valve and hot water pressure relief valve. There are more possibilities, too.Put on your Sherlock Holmes cap and be alert to what's happening the next time you hear the squeal. It can come from the startup or idle down of a motor. What runs regularly? Furnace, refrigerator, freezer. Pay attention to what else is happening close in time to the squeal.Smoke alarms, when the battery is dying, will put out a random sound usually described as a "chirp" but that might come out as a short squeal.Doors can squeal when opened or closed or moved by the wind.At one time, way back when, TVs had tubes. When a tube was going bad there would often be a 60-cycle squeal. Only about one in three people could hear it. This would usually happen when the TV was turned on or off. Nowadays I would doubt anything like this, but hey, who knows?Some devices have a low battery warning even when turned off, and what about a forgotten alarm? Is there a lost cell phone in the couch cushions or a clock radio buried under clothing?Be imaginative. Use your hearing, your eyes, and your sense of what is going on to help isolate the cause. Then you can have Dr. Watson write your memoirs."When you have eliminated all which is impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth." --  Sherlock Holmes "Adventure of the Blanched Soldier" <SEP> How do I find and fix the source of a high-pitched squeal periodically sounding in my house?

I figure it might be my heating system, but can't seem to locate it in any one place.

LitlBit is pretty much right on. The pressure at your house is what it is and there isn't much you can do especially if you use city controlled water. If you are on a private well, you might be able to bump up the pressure at the pump. What you really are looking for is to increase the volume at the shower head. Removing restrictors is definitely one way. The only other practical way would be to increase pipe size which is probably not cost efficient. <SEP> How can you increase the water pressure in your shower.

An electric generator works just the opposite of an electric motor. Where a current applied to an electric motor spins a magnet inside a copper coil, a generator spins (via gas engine) the magnet inside the copper coil to produce a current. If you are having mechanical problems, you'd service it like any small engine. If the engine runs fine but it doesn't produce a current, then you know its the generator. As for how to repair either, I couldn't tell you. I'd just take it in to a small engine repair shop. <SEP> how does a portable electric generator work. How do you check & repair.?

This isn't a solution to your issue as such, but if it's not so much an issue of time taken to download the file, vs. convenience of attaching it, then in Chrome you can:   open the email  download it and it you get a button for it at the bottom of the Chrome window  create your new email and drag it back from the bottom of the Chrome window onto your email   So the only benefit of this method is that you don't have to search for the download in Windows Explorer / Finder and is therefore only marginally more convenient.  I feel your pain too though as this is something I do frequently in fat clients, so would welcome a proper answer.

Lets not run to re-wire so fast.  A grounded system is a great idea.  Especially for safety, not to mention computer grounding, stereo equipment, etc. that is susceptible to static and free electrical problems.You need to find out if the wiring was ran through shielded conduit to a metal junction box where your plug is located.  If so many times the conduit can be grounded.As is always the case, and as mentioned above, you and your family's safety is the first concern.  Spend the money and call in a licensed electrician who specializes in remodeling.   Too many sparkies only do new construction and are not electricians - they just work under one whom may or may not be on the job-site.  Furthermore codes are so different from area to area.

First thing you should do is setup your filter.. make sure it's running correctly.Next, vacuum the bottom of your pool and skim the debris off the top.Add lots of chlorine. I get a 5 gallon barrel from my local supplier. Add a bottle of Algaecide concentrate (R60). Run your filter continuously for several days. Your sand filter will require frequent backwashing.

Unless you figure out a way to disable the light, the only way to get it to go away is to have the car hooked up to what is called an OBD II.  All mechanics shops have them.  It's a handheld device that reads the computer codes that caused the light to go on in the first place.  There are numerous sensors attached to the engine, and if any one of them gives readings that are outside the suggested parameters, the light will come on.  If it goes off, then the computer is no longer receiving a bad signal.  You most likely will have to have a sensor replaced before it will go away. <SEP> How do I turn off the check engine light of a 2000 Mazda Miata?

remove the brake lines going to the master. Then remove the bolts that hold the master in place on the booster. With the new master, put it in a vice, add brake fluid, remove the plastic caps and let the gravity bleed the system until fluid runs from the ports. You can puch from the rear of the cylinder to force the fluid out, but then you would have to hold the piston in and place your fingers over the ports before you let go of the piston on the rear of the cylinder. Do this until fluid drips freely. then install the master on the booster without the lines yet. Have someone go inside the car and slowly push down on the brake pedal, once they go all the way to the floor, DO  NOT LET THE PEDAL MOVE BACK UP! this will allow air in the system. So when the pedal is on the floor, you go and install the 2 lines back onto the master. One the 2 lines are both on and tight, have your partner release the pedal back up. What this does is pull the air out of the lines and into the master. Top off the master til full, put the cover back on and your done. Test the pedal. If the pedal is spongy , then you allowed air into the system and you need to bleed it. But that is for another question if you need it.Good luck...Ron <SEP> how do i remove the master cylinder on a 1998 jeep wrangler?

Wow, I just did this last weekend!  If it's floor tile, the easiest way to do it is to use a dremel with a tile bit.  It only took me about an hour to do my whole kitchen floor.  I just had the dremel in one hand and the shop vac in the other and ran the bit down the grout lines and it drilled it all out.  I just set my depth for the bit about 1/4" let the tile be my guide as I had the bit touching the edge of one tile during the first pass and the edge of the other tile on the way back through that line.  I was worried about it chipping the tile, but it didn't...maybe I got lucky...use at your own risk.  The second way which I started out doing and it took forever was to use a grout saw it's like a screwdriver with a saw blade on the end of it shaped like a blade you put in a utility knife but with teeth and just saw out the grout.  Just start sawing along a tile edge, then saw the edge on the other tile, then break out the grout between the saw lines and suck it all up with the shop vac.  I spent $10 on the grout saw and $8 on the dremel bit (actually made by rotozip but it fits in a dremel) at Home Depot.  If you have a dremel, I'd definately suggest using it for a floor, for a wall I'd CAREFULLY try the dremel bit but probably recommend the saw. <SEP> how do i remove grout from between tiles?
Do you have a old complete lock set and no instructions?  If so go to a hardwear store and find the same type of lock and take notes of instructions.  You could also buy the lock make a copy of instructions and then return lock set.  You will need a tape or rule of some type, drill, hole saw sized at the size of lock set.  I would also suggest a round file and a hammer and wood chisel.1) Locate the Holes Wrap the template included with the instructions around the edge of the door and tape it in place. The template accurately locates the exact spots for drilling into the door. A knob should generally be 38 to 40 inches above the floor; keep the height consistent throughout the house. Then, using an awl, mark the centers of the holes for the lock assembly. The center of the hole in the face of the door should backset between 2-1/4 to 2-3/4 inches from the edge of the door, depending upon the type of lockset.     2) Drill a Hole Through the DoorUsing a power drill with a hole-saw bit of the size recommended by the lock manufacturer, bore a hole into the door. Position the bit on the mark that was made with the awl and then, holding the drill steady, drill the hole through door just until it starts to break through to the other side. Then, to avoid splintering the wood, complete the drilling from the opposite side of the door. (Fig. 2)    3) Drill a Hole in the Door's EdgeNext, using a spade bit of the size recommended by the lock manufacturer, drill a hole into the edge of the door for the latch and latch plate. Drill through to the hole that was drilled in Step 2 on the face of the door.    4) Install the LocksetInsert the latch mechanism into the hole on the edge of the door and trace a line around the latch plate. Remove the latch mechanism and, using a sharp 1-1/4-inch wood chisel, make a mortise in the edge of the door so that the latch plate will be flush with the door. Insert the latch mechanism again, making sure the angled side of the latch is facing toward where the strike plate will sit in the door jamb  Before you screw it to the door, insert the lockset, making sure it is properly connected to the latch mechanism (if this is a keyed lockset, align the keyway downward, as shown). Then, tighten all screws.   5) Mark the Latch PositionClose the door and, using a sharp pencil, pinpoint the spot where the center of the latch hits the door jamb. (Fig. 5)   6) Position and Attach the Strike PlateHold the strike plate against the door jamb, aligning the center of the opening in the plate with the pencil mark made for the latch. Trace the outer edges and inner opening of the strike plate onto the door jamb. (Fig. 6) With a sharp wood chisel, cut a mortise into the jamb equal to the depth of the strike plate so that the plate will lie flush with the edge of the jamb. If the cut is too deep, use cardboard to raise the plate so it is flush. To make room for the latch, use a chisel or a spade drill to bore a hole at the center of the strike plate opening. Screw the strike plate to the jamb. Close the door and recheck the alignment of the latch and strike plate before tightening the screws. <SEP> how to drill a door lock hole? tools to be use and instructions

I f you take your time and are particular to make a good job tiling is remarkably easy, just remember to tack a level wooden batten to the wall for your first tile to sit on and then when the wall is tiled remove the batten and tile in the space below, the reason for this is that no room is square and it looks really bad if you end up with a sliver of tile or a gap filled with grout, so always space your tiles first see how it looks and then start with a half tile on the horizontal and vertical, never ever start with a full tile, as if you start with a half you can make your tiles go bigger and smaller with the wall, try to make sure that where the tile edges meet each other they are fairly level( if they are not just pull the tile out where necessary) and not dipping in or proud of each other as you dont want any brown edges of the tiles showing through the grout having said that grouting hides a multitude of sins,clean off any adhesive as soon as possible, take special care and after a day grout it, only do small sections at a time say two foot square as grout sets quick on a dry joint, when you have grouted a small area then take a grouting tool or the round end of a pencil will do and rub the joints, clean with a almost dry sponge then rub joints again filling in any pin holes then clean again, repeat for the rest of the wall. If the wall is very bad, before you tile you could always level the wall with plasterboard or some waterproof equivalent. Always use waterproof adhesive and grout,  .im not a tiler I am a plasterer but recently have been doing a fair bit of tiling and although a little slow and fussy I have been delighted with the results its much easier than you might think. <SEP> How to set tile?
The reason ice dams form is because there is heat getting into your attic. This melts the snow on your roof which re-freezes when it gets down to the colder eaves. This can cause leaks as the ice can actually back up under the shingles. You need a good insulation blanket on the floor of your attic or, if insulating the rafters, make sure to install styrofoam baffles that will allow cold air to circulate between the roof sheathing and insulation. Ideally, you only want the snow to melt because it's warm outside, not because your attic is warm, this reduces the chance of a re-freeze at the eaves.A tell tale sign of poor attic insulation is when you look at a roof and can see the rafter lines because they're still covered in snow while the spaces between the rafters has melted. <SEP> how do i stop icicles & ice buildup on the edge of my house roof?

You need to what we call backflush or reverse the flow of the coolant in the system. as the engine gets hotter ther thermostat located usually near the top of the engine will open and allow coolant to flow to the radiator where it then falls through the channels and the mving air passing through the radiator cools it, so your coolant flows in this direction to remove impurities you have to reverse the flow.  Remove the thermostat and then force water the opposite way round the system including the radiator, you can add a flushing compound but the most important thing is to continue witth this until you get clear water, when finished refit the thermostat and new gasket/seal if it has one and then add the correct amount of antifreeze and top off with water til it reaches the level required, run vehicle with the heater on hot until normal operating temp is reached and then very very carefully using a rag gently remove the pressure cap to check the level, if it is low use warm water to top it up as this will avoid a coolant shock to any of the alloy components and gaskets in the engine.

No need to turn off any water,,, At least not initially.   The "P" trap under the sink is the place to begin, and should be easy to remove,,,using care certainly. The pipe that is the curved one...

The P trap is designed not only to trap gases/odors that may intrude from drain lines, but also manages to collect most everything else that fits down the drain.   If there is something wedged,,IE: hair pins etc, use a wire coat hanger to force the object out.   When replacing wou should have at hand new washers/gaskets to put back when connecting.

If you are good friends with a technician at a local repair center (or if you are good at becoming good friends with people quickly) they may help you out for next to nothing. Some libraries (especially in collage towns) have a version of electronic service information available to the public. You can also take a trip down to your local auto parts store and purchase a Chilton or Haynes manual for around $20, these manuals are limited in the information they give you but they have descriptions of DTC’s (Diagnostic Trouble Codes). From there you can do your pin-point tests to determine the root cause of the problem that set the code. Additionally, there are vast sources on the internet for such information. A simple search could help you determine what the number means; however to properly diagnose the problem, you are going to need access to a bit more than what is available for free on the internet. All Data has a service available that allows you to access the same information shops have for a small fee. And, if you are looking for guidance in repairing the problem yourself, I myself can assist you VIA e-mail. I am in the process of setting up a small internet business unlike any other I have come across, where I walk people through problems with their vehicles for a small fee—cheaper than going to a shop or misdiagnosing and buying unneeded parts, yet enough to make it worth my while to do every night. If you are interested in my assistance (free for now) email me at the address I have in the source section (it isn't a link, type it in replacing the word "at" with the symbol and no spaces) Please note that I don’t have direct access to service information at this time; however, I can make a phone call to one of my old tech school instructors to obtain information for you, it just might take a couple of days—longer if I need to have flow-charts and such sent.

Before you begin make sure you have a leak! Spas lose a lot of water through evaporation. Fill the spa. Turn it off and let the water cool. Mark the water level. Leave it off 24 hours and mark the water level again. Measure the distance between the marks and record this measurement. Now, fill the spa to the original level and run- without heat- for 24 hours. Again, mark the water level and measure. Compare the measurements of "off" and "running". If they are close to being the same, you have no leak, as long as the water loss is negligable. Keep the cover on the spa throughout this process, as it will help to retard any evaporation. If there is a big difference in the measurements, then you have a leak. There are 3 possibilities:1). Spa loses more water running than off. That would be a return line (pressure) leak. Water is forced out under pressure when the pump is on.2). Spa loses more water off than running. Suction side leak. When the pump is on it will suck air in and slow down the amount of loss from water running out. Gravity flows out when the pump is off.3). Both water loss measurements are the same- running or off. That is structural. Leaking around a gasket or some such thing.Do the above and you will have eliminated 3 of 4 possibilities. Let me know which you have and I'll advise you further. Also need to know if the spa is fiberglass, concrete, etc.Hope this helps. We'll find the sucker! <SEP> how do I fix a slow leak in my spa?

You need to hire someone, not do it yourself. The existing walls aren't deep enough to add a chute so you would have to frame one on each level of the house.

Interesting.  I tested by sending an email to my Gmail acct from an Exchange account, and setting the flag urgent.  Then I looked at the email in the web interface and from Outlook. In Outlook (getting Gmail) I saw the message flagged urgent. In the Web interface, I saw no urgent indication.  I replied to the message from the web interface and from Outlook. In the web interface, the urgent flag was not shown, and did not make it back to the Exchange account. In Outlook, the reply did not have the urgent flag activated, but when I activated it it was visible back on the Exchange account.  So, to summarize .. the Gmail web interface does not recognize the urgent flag, at least not as implemented by Microsoft Exchange. But the Gmail engine does not lose the header data when it is provided by another client.  As an aside .. I find the urgent flag far more irritation than it is worth.  Rarely does "urgent" to you mean that it should be "urgent" to me. When is the last time that you received a message flagged "low priority"?  IMHO it is far better to indicate in the subject and body that the issue is urgent or time-sensitive.  EDIT: Google just added (1-Sept-2010) the "Priority Inbox" functionality and some kind of importance measure. I will redo my tests and update. <SEP> Send urgent mail in Gmail

sounds like you have no electricity live in the box. What you have is an interupter wire for the light.Technicly it should be 2 black wires.

MindTouch Platform and MindTouch Core are both self-hosted. The UI is non-invasive and very clean. You can use MindTouch Platform in conjunction with the desktop connecter to import your docs. More steps than viewing a document in Google Docs, but does give you the security of your fire wall. And the WYSIWYG editor makes editing documents as simple as Word.  [As a css junkie and a page linking maverick, I would much rather stay out of Office products and use a solution like MindTouch.] You can still "Paste from Word" in the free edition if you don't want to pay for Platform.

If you take the number of amps printed on your circuit breaker times the your voltage (probably 110v), that will equal the amout of watts your appliances can put out before they exceed the rating of the breaker.  Example:  15 amp breaker times 110v = 1650 watts  which means you could run 1 1500 watt toaster and 1 150 watt light bulb.  The amount of wattage your appliance consumes should be print on it.  So as long as you don't exceed the capacity with the appliances, that are running, you can plug in as many as you want.  Just don't run them all at once.  Hope this helps.

95% of trapped odors are in your carpet, most likely from mildew. To get rid of the odor, you first have to get rid of its source. Go to your local auto supply store (auto zone, advance, O' Reilly, NAPA, etc) and buy some upholstery/carpet shampoo. Look for a kind that also disinfects if available. First vacuum the carpet. Then test the shampoo in a small inconspicuous area to make sure it is color safe. Work the shampoo in really well, blot it dry with a clean cloth, and then let it dry thoroughly. Then vacuum the carpet and upholstery again. you may need to do this a couple of times depending o the severity of the mildew so don't get frustrated. After you're done give the carpet a couple of squirts of your favorite cologne, or air freshener, for a finishing touch. Then you'll be good to go. Hope this helps. <SEP> how do you get rid of a musty odor in your car if it has been wet inside before?

Same issue still exists. We are getting around it by creating separate sheets for each user that reference the main sheet, but with 'if then' logic applied to only show the info pertinent to that user. Other user's rows are programmed to appear as -----. That user's sheet is now a filtered duplicate of the main sheet that can then be filtered more as needed without messing up anyone else's view. We are now going to create another sheet that references the users' sheets, without pulling the ----- cells. The reason being that the users can now edit their sheets, and all changes will appear in the final sheet. It makes the main sheet a 'rough draft', and the final sheet the edited version.

The first answer is terribly dangerous.  No one knowledgeable or responsible would ever suggest using a double male cord, let alone run around your house trying to find somewhere suitable to plug it in!I operate my well pump, furnace, fridge, freezer, microwave and toaster ovens, computer, television, VCR, satellite receiver, lots of lights, and so on from a 5500 watt generator during power outages.  Properly sized and installed the output will be perfectly usable with no further conditioning required.If you are serious about backup generator power you will require a specialized transfer panel to isolate the home electrical system and prevent the generator from backfeeding the street, potentially with lethal results.  This should be done by someone qualified, obtaining proper permits, and following all electrical code requirements.Read through my generator page for safety information, connection details, and so on.

Here is a script-based solution which allows one to insert a table with the contents from a given range within a given spreadsheet. I did not try to find a way to sync data real-time, as it didn't seem practical given potentially large volume of data that would have to be transferred with every edit to the spreadsheet. Instead, the script adds a custom menu item "update data" to the document.  The script should be bound to the document (i.e., created using Tools > Script Editor in the document menu). The spreadsheet URL, as well as the sheet and range to use, are specified within the script. To embed all the data on the sheet, replace .getRange(rangeName) with .getDataRange() .  When the function updateData is first executed, it appends the table at the end of document. At subsequent runs, it updates the table in place (i.e., if  more text is added after the table, the order will be preserved).  Note that cutting-pasting the table would break the updating process (the script would add a new table at the end) since the pasted copy is a new object. Instead, cut-paste the text around the table.  function onOpen() {   DocumentApp.getUi()              .createMenu('Custom')              .addItem('Update Data', 'updateData')              .addToUi(); }  function updateData() {   var ssUrl = ' spreadsheet url here ';   var sheetName = 'Sheet2';   // name of sheet to use   var rangeName = 'A1:C3';    // range of values to include     var values = SpreadsheetApp.openByUrl(ssUrl)                              .getSheetByName(sheetName)                              .getRange(rangeName)                              .getValues();   var doc = DocumentApp.getActiveDocument();   var body = doc.getBody();   var ranges = doc.getNamedRanges('embeddedSheet-range');   if (ranges.length == 0) {     var table = body.appendTable(values);   }   else {     tableRange = ranges[0];     table = tableRange.getRange().getRangeElements()[0].getElement();     var ind = body.getChildIndex(table);     tableRange.remove();     body.removeChild(table);     table = body.insertTable(ind, values);   }   var rangeBuilder = doc.newRange();   rangeBuilder.addElement(table);   doc.addNamedRange('embeddedSheet-range', rangeBuilder.build()); }  Technical notes   It's also possible to sync the data every hour, in addition to manually. Just add a time-based trigger from Script Editor's Resources menu, so that it runs the function updateData.  One can also adapt this script to be bound to the source spreadsheet instead. This would require changes in how the document is opened (e.g., by URL), but otherwise the logic is the same.  The cumbersome part of the script is getting the handle of the existing table in the document. This requires placing it within a Named Range. Also, it is much more expedient to completely replace the table element than to mess with the entries of an existing table. Since a Named Range is immutable, it is also removed with the table it contains, and then created again, along with the new table. <SEP> Embed Google Spreadsheet in Google Document
one of the best products I have found is GOO GONE, it is yellow and vaguely lemony smelling, and probably won't damage the finish on your table. as to the scratches, there is a wood"crayon" type of thing in a variety of different colors(your local home depot or lowes etc..)

Changing the camber and toe in your car, without a working knowledge of how it works is not a good idea. It will decrease the handling and braking of the car. Take it to a repair shop with a good reputation and spend the money. Also by spending a little cash, you will get a guarantee of the work being performed.

glazing is installing. you can take out the old piece of glass using a putty knife to cut through any glue or silicone. be sure to get all the broken pieces out before putting the new one in. then run a bead of clear silicone against your frame. put the piece of glass in and press to seal against the silicone. then run plastic glazing bead around the outside edege. or wood depending on the frame. if you can't find any glazing bead then put another thicker bead of silicone over the outside of the glass. you will have "glazed" the window. if the window is putty glazed, you can buy that at the hardware store also. 33 glazing putty works well. but any putty can be a tough job. so depending on how easy you want it or the type of frame its in, any way you go, silicone will seal the unit in place. you can use a silicone latex blend if you want to paint over it later. <SEP> how do you re-glaze a window.is caulk the same as glaze?

First thing, DO NOT WASH IT IN HOT WATER! That will set the stain in. The best thing I've done is to pretreat the stain with dawn dishwashing liquid or dishwasher detergent.

There is a tensioner pulley on the top of the engine. My suggestion is, if there is no diagram sticker on the hood or radiator mount, take a photo of the engine before you remove the old belt.

I just did some repairs to some lath and plaster this morning. You need to pick off any "loose" pieces at the edges of your existing hole. Your 1 foot by 3 foot repair may become larger! It's tough to know when to stop. When you feel you have removed the most loose pieces, it's time to start the repair. You need to purchase some "setting type" joint compound. It comes in a powder that you add water to, and mix to a consistancy that is slightly thinner than peanut butter. It should'nt sag when applied to the wall. Fill the area and put some mesh tape over the edges. The joint compound that you purchase should be a 90 minute setting type. This means it will be dry within that time and you can reapply some more to finish it. I would also suggest using a regular joint compound to "feather out" and finish the area. It's easier to sand. This job is a little tricky. It takes alot of practice to get familiar with the tools and to get a good feel for the material. If you apply the joint compound evenly and smooth at each coat, you should have minimal sanding only after the last coat is applied.   Good luck  (If you have to remove to much plaster I would suggest screwing on a piece of 1/4 inch drywll in the area.) <SEP> How do I repair a lathe and plaster wall?

you can use a lot of products out there to remove paint. some of it is designed to remove it and yet others can damage it if used wrong.  Yes you could buff it out but try using a little laquer thinner on a rag. Don't rub real hard or you can damage the paint under it. Since the paint from the other car is on top of the wax and clearcoat it isn't really stuck on as hard as the paint on your car. I have also used easy off oven cleaner to remove paint off of vehicles that have been bumped or had lettering put on the sides for commercial vehicles. Just spray it on and let it sit for a few minutes then wipe clean. make sure it is not cold when you do this as the warmer it is the faster and better it will work. Also no matter what you use insure that you give the area a good waxing before you let the car sit out in the weather as any cleaner that you use will remove or damage the wax coating as well. If you have scratches in your paint after you remove the unwanted persons paint then you can get touch up paint at your local body shop or parts store. Touch up the paint prior to waxing or it won't stick. I have over 5 years body shop experiance and have had to remove tons of paint off cars including graffitti spray painted onto vehicles. Believe me "Easy Off oven cleaner" does work for the more tougher jobs.  For minor jobs try graffiti remover or goof off. In some cases just "WD40" will work.

Depends on what car you are talking about. Every computer controlled car has a different voltage input for the oxygen sensor. The sensor sends a voltage signal and tells the computer if the engine timing needs to be adjusted or not. The eliminator sets this to one constant voltage that tells the computer to advance the timing and leave it there. Thus giving your car better performance and acceleration. But you will need to find what that voltage is at WOT for your car. If you have a car with OBDII system (most 1996 to present cars) then you may can get a programmer to bypass these signals and manually set it to what you want. <SEP> how do you bypass the oxygen sensor?

If your main bearings are worn out most likely the other bearings and parts in the engine are worn as well.

Bleach will not strictly KILL it. If it happens to get to walls, removal of the drywall is the best step.

If the screen you have came with your door then you might have the type that has plastic inserts that run up the sides and across the top and bottom.  Look at the door from the inside, it may look as part of the trim but, you should be able to get a flat screwdriver in between the edge of the door's window frame and a tiny lip on the plastic strip.  Twist the screwdriver and it should start to pop loose, then you can pull the strip out.  Repeat on all sides.  Pull out the glass then replace it with the screen panel.  Then put back the strips, they should pop back into place with a little effort.  All this is of course if you have that type of door.  If not sorry for all the extra reading.  Hope this helps.

Depends on the mower, but there are two basic ways to do it.  Unplug the spark plug and check under the mower for a small plug going into the bottom of the engine.  That should be the oil drain plug & it normally has a square head.  If thats what you find, loosen the plug a bit, set the mower back down and lift it up on supports high enoght to put a drain pan underneath.  With the pan underneathe, take out the drain plug and the oil will flow into the pan.  After its stopped draining, replace the plug and tighten it snugly, but don't over tighten it.  Refill with new oil and your ready to go.On lawn tractors and some other mowers the plug is located in the engine block or at the end of a sort pipe above the mower deck or engine mount.  In his case, just get a pan in position to catch the oil remove the plug or pipe cap and follow the directions from above.Remember you want to do t=his with the oil warm, but not hot!!

Here's another good blog post about the frustrations of using Wolfram|Alpha. Until they work out the user interface problems, W|A will remain a curiosity.

Dont listen to people who say oh its only 2004, its new, you dont need to, your filter life depends on the air quality in your area, but a year, or 12,000 to 15,000 miles, typically is the recommended replacement interval. A cabin air filter may be in the outside air intake, visible with the hood up and perhaps a cover lifted. Or it will be under the dash in one or both of two general locations:• Above the blower in the back section of the outside air intake, a location well protected from moisture.• Between the blower and the rest of the HVAC case.If the owner's manual doesn't tell you the location, and you can't see it with the hood open, check behind the glovebox--perhaps you'll see an obviously removable (with a spring-tab or similar retainer) rectangular plastic cover. Next, look under the dash (on both the driver's and passenger's sides) for a removable plastic cover in the HVAC case. If you can remove its cover, look inside the HVAC case.Still no answer? Buy the filters, something you have to do anyway. You've got two choices:• Buy the factory filters at the dealership at full price. This way, you'll know for sure what they look like and get some idea about how they have to be installed. You'll also find out how many your vehicle has. The parts department should have a diagram to show you where the filters are located in the car.• Buy aftermarket filters that come with step-by-step instructions from an auto parts store. The odds of the original equipment parts coming with instructions are extremely slim. Do all aftermarket filters have them? No, but if you're shopping at a parts store, you should be able to check in the boxes on the shelves. Also, these parts probably will cost less.Replacing The Filters In The Air IntakeThe filter in the outside air intake (even if there are other filters) takes care of most of the dust and pollen, so it's likely to plug first.The typical procedure begins with removing the air intake screen, which is held by "Christmas tree" plastic fasteners. If the "tree" has a center pin, pry it up with a thin-blade screwdriver and then wiggle the tree out of the hole. If the tree is a single-piece design, you'll have to pry it out. Most of the time, it will break and you'll have to replace it (blister packs of replacements are sold in most auto parts stores).If there's a rain/snow deflector over the filter, remove it, then extract the element. The filter element may be held by a plastic tab, or it may slip into a retainer housing that you will reuse with the new element. Some dust may have gotten around or through the filter. Use a vacuum cleaner to clean the outside air intake duct. Be careful when you reinstall the air intake screen, as well as any cover over the filter element. If the gasket surface around the screen does not seal, or if the cover (actually a shield, in most cases) is not reinstalled, rainwater can flow into the filter, saturating it.In The Case, Above The BlowerIf the filter is in the case above the blower, most likely it is behind the glovebox. Removing the glovebox may be easy, but you may not have to remove it at all.Many filters (such as on most Hondas and Toyotas) are just above the blower behind the glovebox, and you'll have to drop it for access. In the best of cases, you can flex the sides of the box so the pins clear the dash, then pivot the box down for clearance. In others, the entire glovebox assembly has to come out, which means removing a number of retaining screws, not all of which are visible.The cabin filter is a type of air filter that in some respects--such as pleating to provide a lot of surface area in a small package--may resemble an engine air filter. However, it usually is made of different materials, the main one being a charcoal layer in many elements. Like some engine air filters, the dust and pollen filtering ele <SEP> How do I replace the 2004 kia sedona cabin air filter?

You can unplug the connector to disable the lock-up.  It is easy to get to.  Replacing the solenoid is easy also.

You're gonna need chemicals. Lysol, Ozium are good starts. Park the car outside, switch the A/C on full blast, and make sure it's on outside air (not recirc). Roll up the windows and get out of the car. If you look near the windshield wipers, you should be able to see a vent near the base of the windshield. Spray lysol into this vent, about 1/4 of the can. This will kill all the mold that's hiding in your vents, as well as blast lysol into your interior. Let the car run for a few minutes after wards then shut it off. This should help quite a bit. Next is to treat it with Ozium a few times to get rid of what's left of the smell. I'm sure there's other methods that work better, but this is easy to do yourself and costs less than $10.

What ever you do, don't listen to FT.  Nor do you use a jackhammer.  Talk about trying to gain free points.Anyway what Dodgeman says is correct for the most part.  Remove the lower caliper bolt, using a screwdriver, push the piston back a little bit and swing the caliper up.  Slide the caliper from the bracket that holds it.  Hang the caliper with a cord or something, do not allow it to hang freely as this can damage the brake hose.Remove the caliper bracket and then remove the rotor, may need to smack it with a hammer to remove it.I use a grinding disc to clean the hub so there is no rust.  This helps to eliminate the chance of causing a pulsation in the rotor.  I also use a wire brush to clean the caliper bracket where the pads slide and use brake grease from NAPA to lube them up to allow the pads to slide.  Now is also a good time to push the piston back into the caliper.To re-install, place the rotor on the hub and install the caliper bracket and tighten down.  Install the brake pads correctly (I usually put a small amount of silicone grease on the back of the pads to reduce squealing).  Install the caliper and tighten.

Cave and camel crickets are of little economic importance except as a nuisance in buildings and homes, especially basements. They are usually "accidental invaders" that wander in by mistake from adjacent areas. They generally do not reproduce indoors, except in situations that provide continuous dark, moist conditions as well as organic debris to serve as food.Control efforts for camel crickets should include (as much as is practical) eliminating breeding and hiding sites outdoors around the house or building. Piles of bricks, stones, boards, leaves, etc., should be removed. Also, cracks and gaps in foundation or siding or around windows and doors should be sealed. House centipedes are a natural predatory form of control, but most homeowners are uncomfortable having them around, despite their beneficial nature. Occasional, individual crickets can be easily picked or swept up and discarded. If there is a breeding population and chemical control is desired, spraying a residual barrier of diazinon, Dursban or Sevin insecticide around the outside of the house may be of benefit if you apply sufficient spray to reach breeding sites. Spraying household "ant and cockroach" insecticide onto indoor floor areas where camel crickets hide or are seen is a last resort of limited benefit. <SEP> How do I get rid of camel crickets?

Serpentine belts are typically flat, multi-ribbed and about 1 1/4 inch wide and have a tensioner that automatically keeps the belt tight. They literally "snake" around many power accessory pulleys.So you must be talking about a "V belt", named for the V shape that rides in the pulleys it drives. V belts are tightened individually by loosening the bolts which hold the driven accessory alternator, pump, compressor or other in place. Don't remove the bolts completely if you attempt to tighten the belt, and sometimes you need somebody to use a lever bar or similar to rotate the accessory and tighten the belt while you retighten the bolts. Some people try "belt dressing" to stop a slipping V belt (not for use on serpentine belts), but the best thing is to tighten or replace the belt if it is 6 years old or more. An auto repair manual (like Haynes) from the auto parts store can show details of which bolts to loosen, or you can go to a library and use their auto repair manuals. <SEP> how to fix a lose fan belt?

Not many options here. The key is you need to get the plunger out of the drain pipe. You can try a long pair of pliers or a hanger bent in to a small hook (about 1/2" would be about right). If you can't get it from the tub, you either have to go under or in from behind. If the tub is on the first floor and you have a basement or crawl space, you might be able to get in from there.

Problem is, the thing is so old that the lever has corroded off and the mechanism/plunger are permanently clogging up the drain.  The tub drains, but very slowly.  I have tried pouring down boiling water, white vinegar, and drano.  Have tried pulling on the tripwaste with pliers.

If it's closing to fast, best bet is to replace the hinges with "lighter" units. Some custom hinges and most exterior gate spring loaded hinges have a "roll pin" adjustment to increase or decrease tension. Youll need an adjustment tool, usually a drift pin, to move the roll pin assembly one way or the other to adjust tension. <SEP> How do you adjust a spring loaded hinge on a door?
A Google Docs document encodes everything in 'elements' within the Kix editor that it's all based on (it's closed source as basically this is the big trade secret, with which anyone else could run their own Docs service - which is a shame imo).  You can access these elements with Google Apps Script, a variant of Javascript - but writing Markdown from the elements isn't as straightforward as you'd think (you have to essentially implement a markdown parser in Apps Script).  When I came to do this earlier in the year there were dozens of forks of Renato Mangini's " gdocs2md " repo, but he seemed to have stopped fielding pull requests, and over the period of a few years forks had appeared that were far better than others. I went through many of these in the tree and put the best into a new package, which also generates HTML mixed with the markdown for elements Google Docs supports such as superscript and subscript elements (which markdown has no way of representing). Even incorporating the best of others' edits, the parsing needed work, and I'm confident that this is the best available for the job at present.  Script available on GitHub with installation instructions:  lmmx/gdocs2md-html  I also worked on adding in the most important feature to such a script - user features - providing the markdown in a pop-up within Google Docs rather than saving to file (I think the original was batch saving for entire folders, which is not suitable for my document-drafting needs, or how I use Google Docs at all).    I'd like to suggest it be a single more sophisticated project for interested developers to collaborate on (or at least suggest features for) rather than everyone forking off scripts of various quality, when we're likely working to the same aims.  As well as reducing duplication of effort, the Google Docs policy for creation of "add-ons" states that to be published (and therefore 'installable' rather than needing to be loaded for each document in a slightly awkward manner)    The add-on must be fully functional — it can't be a “work in progress.”  The script has been tested with multiple active users.    Obviously if you wanted a "pure" markdown then either switch off these features (the code is there to fork) or just don't use sub/superscripts, etc. It wouldn't be too difficult to add personalised settings to such a script if it matures as an add-on, if there's significant interest. <SEP> How can Google Docs and markdown play nice?

About the easiest way is to get the car in the air (ramps or jack stands) start the engine and let it idle, and have someone "plug" the tailpipe with a couple of rags. This will create back-pressure in the exhaust system, and you'll hear a loud hissing noise from the leak. Just follow the hiss until you find the source, and there's the leak!! You should also be able to feel air coming out of the leak. DON'T TOUCH THE EXHAUST, IT IS VERY HOT!!! Also note that most mufflers have a drain hole in them that will leak a small amount of air- this is normal.

You do not need to remove the back seat. You have to remove the back wheel and the plastic innner wheel well though. It may be hard to manuver in the small space were the filter is if you have large hands. You will need to depress the tabs on the lines where they connect to the filter. There are 2 of them on each line that are 180 degrees from each other. Chances are you have new lines that came with the filter. They made a change in the filter to a longer one and the lines need to be used to fit it. Make sure you connect the lines to the filter before setting it in place.  After filter is in place.

despite what people think. alot of companies now do make custom parts for home brew turbo kits. obviously tuning companies will have reasearched the situation much more than me or you would be able too. But a generic build would require dropping of the compression ratio (low comp pistons) and a low pressure turbo would be your best bet (something like a standard unit from say a nissan 200SX S13 series - Garret T25). you will need an intercooler too just for piece of mind. The biggest issue on the whole idea would be the management and the fueling. Your best bet on that would be a honda modding site as there are plenty of people who have taken that route with the B16 and B18 engines and reached power in the region of 300+. if anyone can help you out it would be them.The biggest money eater in any conversion is the installation labour as a tuner/garage will charge a small fortune to get the parts in the car, if your competant or have people who are and can help you could build up the block out of the car yourself, fit it and then get it set up and mapped on the rollers and most defo save money. <SEP> How can u build an inexpensive turbo kit?

you did not state what is wrong with the axle.is the ring & pinion or differential shot?or is there something wrong with the hubs.contrary to what the dude before said, an axle from the 88-2001 GM trucks is going to cost a whole lot more then the previous year 14 bolt rear ends. the rear ends from a 73-87 body style truck are a dime a dozen and should only cost you $100-$200 at a junkyard.the 14 bolt axle had some design changes that started in 1988, and they arent as common as the old version (the old version came in the 3/4 and 1 ton trucks, the 1988 3/4 ton trucks used a semi floating axle as well as the full floating).  also since they arent as plentiful as the old design 14 bolt, they cost more, i would expect to pay in the area of $900+ to from a wrecker.depending on what bearings need to be replace, if its the differential bearings, you can get the entire kit for around $110-$150, and a gear set for $200, and then add $300-$400 for a shop to set them up.  luckily from the 14 bolts design, they are probaly the easiest axle to setup gears on so the shops dont charge as much as they would say a Dana series axle.they also charge less if you just bring them the housing out of the truck instead of the entire truck, its easier to replace everything while it is sitting on a bench instead of under the truck. <SEP> How to repair and replace a rearend of 97 Chev.

If your transmission is an automatic, you would check it while the engine is running.  However, if your transmission is a manual (has a clutch pedal), you will need to have the engine turned off for a few minutes to get an accurate indication of the fluid level as viewed through the fill plug hole.

When replacing brakes.  The front rotors (disks) are held in place by the calipers. There are 2 bolts that hold the calipers to the mounting plate. Typically allen head (hex)or torx (star) fasteners are used to secure the calipers.The mounting plate is held on by two bolts. (17-19 mm)1st jack the car up, place on stands, then chock the rear wheels. leave the steering wheel unlocked by placing the keyto the unlock position, but not in the on position.Turn the wheels so the inboard rear is accessible to the side you will start on. Remove the wheels. remove the caliper bolts, lift straight up on the caliper, and the brake pads can be slid out of the mounting plate. Remove the mounting plate, and the rotor will slide off.  if the rotor does not move. tap it gently with a rubber mallot.Remove the master cylinder cap (where the brake fluid is filled)) Get a "C" clamp that screws shut by turning it (any auto parts store will have one) Put an old brake pad against  the caliper piston (metal side against the piston)and compress the piston into the caliper until the metal part of the pad is flush with the caliper.The rotors can be taken to an auto parts store (I recommend Napa) They will measure the thickness of your rotors, and will tell you if they need to be replaced.  If not, they will resurface the rotors. When reinstalling.  first the rotor, then the mounting plate. Slide the brake pads on, along with any anti rattle clips or springs, that were on the car. Then the the compressed caliper. (if the calipers dont fit back on, you will need to compress a little more)  Same for both sides.Put the master cylinder cap back on, and pump the brake pedal until it becomes firm, and hard.  Check the brake fluid level, and ensure all fasteners are tight.Replace the wheels, tighten all lugnuts, put the car back on its wheels.  Test brakes in the driveway, and make certain they are stopping properly.  Good luck <SEP> How to change your car breaks,what if the disc is bad too? My car is Daewoo Leganza 2000.

Your car can pull left or right for a number of reasons, one of which is poor alignment. Unless you hit something or your car has a buttload of miles on it or you played Ricky Racer and tampered with the springs, chances are your alignment is fine. Worn or out-of-balance tires often play havoc with your steering. They will make it do all kinds of funny things, like pull to one side, or shake the steering wheel, or make your car very hard to steer, especially at low speed. The two expendable things in the suspension system of your car are tires and shocks (or struts). More driving, more wear. So get them checked first if you are having handling or tire wear issues. Poor alignment will make your tires wear unevenly, as will worn shocks or struts. If you wreck your car or hit the curb hard enough, your alignment can get messed up. Over time, rubber components in the suspension go bad, causing misalignment. I wouldn't get it checked more than once every couple of years. In fact, I never have had it checked on any of my cars. Never had problems, either. <SEP> How do you know if your alignment is messed up? How often do you need to get that looked at?

4.0 liter probably doesnt have a belt tensioner.  Most 4 liter dodge engines you have to loosen the idler pully and then the screw on top of the idler pully screws the idler down when you loosen it.  I could be wrong but I know that most 4 liters i have done are this way no tensioner just an idler pully that slides down when you loosen it. If it does have a tensioner then you should be able to use a 1/4 in ratchet.  Insert into the hole on the end of the tensioner and pull back.  I wrote to someone before about how to change a belt on a jeep.  This is what I said.  not that easy there is no tensioner on a 4.0 liter. First you need a 15mm socket. There is a idler pully on the drivers side of engine in front of teh power steering pump. Loosen the bolt in the center of the pully. Do not take all the way out just loosen a few turns. Then once you have the idler loose you need a 13mm socket and extension. Look down on the back side of the idler kind of on top. THere is a bolt that is about 4 inches long that goes down through the back of the pully. Loosen that bolt and the idler pully will slide down taking tensioin off the belt. Do this until you fel the belt is loose enough to remove. Once you have the belt off put new belt back on follow the diagram on the sticker under the hood. Follow the steps in reverse order to tighten. First tighten the bolt until the belt can be twisted about 1/4 to 1/2 side to side. once the belt is tight enough go ahead and tighten the nut on the idler pully and your done. Before you start it is helpfull to look at the bolt on the back and look where the threads are this helps you to get correct tension. also make sure you have the sticker for the diagram under the hood before you start. If you sont make sure you draw the belt or get one. It can be a pain to put back if you have no diagram. Well sorry so long but wanted to be specific. Good luck. <SEP> How do I release the tensioner for the serpentine belt on a jeep? 2001 Jeep Wrangler with 4.0 liter engine.

Not enough detail.  What is it growing on? What type mold?  Bleach only stops it temporarily, it will return,,,certainly depending on it's environment,,,IE? Flooding, reoccurring moisture, etc.   Dehumidifiers can slow it.   I recently replaced all the drywall in an 11,000 sq. ft. building due to damage and black mold growth from flooding. The organization attempted bleach and Kilz without success.  In this case I cut the drywall 2 inches above the floor line and added moulding to the floor. The flooding may still reoccur, but the water will not attack the drywall.   In the case of drywall and paint, the mold attacks the paper on the drywall and leaches through the paint. It does not attack the plaster substance of the drywall, but that is of little consolation in a case as I mentioned.Rev. Steven <SEP> how do i kill mold permantly?

No easy way, but here is a way. Dig around the perimeter to a depth of about two feet by about 18" wide, pour in 8" of gravel and lay in drain pipe (4") with holes facing down.

Depends on the router.  Some have a lock mechanism to lock the shaft and disable the power switch.  Some you have to use two wrenches.  In either case, you will need a box end wrench to loosen the collett that holds the bit.  As you are looking at the business end of the router, the collett needs to rotate counter-clockwise to loosen the bit.  If the bit is still stuck, you will need to get a pair of pliers to GENTLY pull the bit out of the chuck using as light a pressure as you can.  If you have soft jawed pliers, that would be perfect.  You don't want to squeeze the bit so hard, the carbide chips or cracks.  As you are pulling on the bit, keep the shaft in the locked position and pull and rotate gently.  If the bit is still stuck, remove the collett completely and use a flat bladed screw driver to gently pry apart the flutes in the chuck.  Be patient, be gentle.

You must buy a rear-brake rotating tool. (I'm not sure of the technical name) It screws the pistons in instead of pushing them in. Make sure the pistons screw in freely and make sure the e-brake mechanism is functioning properly. These calipers are notorious for seizing and having e-brake problems, in turn causing accelerated wear. My honest opinion, if you must ask how to do it, you probably shouldn't be doing the brakes on your car. The 2 most important things on a car are tires and brakes. If you screw it up, you could end up killing poeple. Please seek professional help if there is any doubt as to what you doing. I know it cost more money, but safety is of the utmost importance. <SEP> How do you replace the rear brake pads on a GM W-body car?

Ok I posted a link below for you to follow, very good source there. Now the DRL or daytime running lamps are something completely different, they are on all the time until you switch on the headlights. Now the auto headlights have a little black sensor on top of the dash by your defroster vents that turn on your headlights when it senses that the light outside is getting dim. They flip on going under bridges and everything else and get a little annoying. Did I follow you right on that one? Now if you want to kill the daytime running lamps do what is suggest above, open the hood and look for the big underhood fuse box and on the lid of that box there will be a diagram on there of what all the fuses and relays are for. Pull the black or gray relay that goes to the drl's and you are done. There is absolutely nothing bad about pulling them. They are NOT for the people who cannot see and not for the handicapped, people who cannot see a car are obviously not going to see lights during the daytime anyway. Their was a research project done back in 95 or 96 saying they did help visibility and reduce crashes but their were several more projects done that proved that wrong and some even said they were distracting. Look now, most vehicles do not have them, some run just front park lamps and a few have drls but the majority of the companies killed the drls, what is suggested below works but it also drags the rear brakes some and keeps either your drums or discs pretty hot. I used one of those infared thermometers and found mine were in fact dragging with one click enough to heat up the rear brakes substantially. <SEP> how can i deactivate auto headlights on a 99 chevy blazer?

if you want factory wiring along with your new aftermarket radio, then you need wiring harness adapter that go along with the type of stero you got.  that way you dont have to cut into any wire which you have no clue of.  that would be the easliest way to get it done.  if you prefer to save some money without buying the adapter, then you need to cut into the factory wiring.  for that 1st need to know which wires are for power. 2nd which are for speakers.  most people think power is usually red but can be different or a mixture of different colors. instead of assume which wire is which.  do it with a multimeter, that would help without burning the fuses.  identify which are speaker wires.  move them aside, you are left with power, ground, antennna etc.  to find the power that mean +12vdc, hook up the meter with black probe touching the chasis or the car.  with key on engine off, the red probe of the meter would be use to test out which is the hot wire.  you would go through the few wires until you know which one is which is +12vdc.  once you get power, ground, antenna figure out, then everything else is easy.  hope that helps <SEP> how to install an aftermarket radio in a 1997 ford taurus sho?

Generally your battery will go dead, and if you drive, all of the lights and such will be dim.  After a certain point your battery will go dead, and your car won't start.If you can still drive it, take it to a parts shop, most of them will check it for free.Good Luck! <SEP> how do you know an alternator is bad?
Debra, the starter must be uninstalled manually.After the starter is in your hands set it down on a surface or table near the vehicles battery.You will need a pair of jumper cables which you will attach to the battery terminals.You must then very carefully touch the cable terminal extensions from the battery to the 'bendix' of the starter (this is the mechanism that sends the gears into the starter motor and also contacts with the 'flywheel') and the other cable to the body or external armature of the starter.The bendix should kick in and the starter should whirl around.If the bendix does not engage the problem may be in the terminal relays. If the starter is engaged by the bendix but refuses to whir, then you may have a problem with the starter shaft bushings. If the bushings are worn out this will allow the body of the rotor to make contact with the starter casing which creates an electrical feed that makes the starter shaft rotate and thusly turn over the flywheel which in turn turns over the engine. Bushings are easy to replace and if you can learn how to do this you will save a bundle.As for the alternator problem you may have a good read out on your battery charging gauge if the alternator is working. Another way to find out whether the alternator is putting out energy is to turn your cars' engine on and then disconnecting one of the battery terminals. If the engine dies out you may have a bad alternator. Another method is by using an electronic meter to measure the alternators output. And by the way, alternators also fall victim to worn bushings that can be replaced by the owner of the car.

Only way to have dirt and crud on the inside of the headlight is if it is cracked and broken and dirt is getting inside.

To start, use a computer and open the Google Chrome browser. If you don’t have Google Chrome, then download it. Then use the Google Chrome browser to go to http://m.facebook.com/messages/  Then click the person you want to see the first message with.  Now press Ctrl + Shift + J and then paste this code into the lower window that pops up, and then press Enter . It will then proceed to load old messages until it reaches the very first message. Here is the code:  setInterval(function () { document.getElementById('see_older') .getElementsByClassName('content')[0].click(); }, 500);  The above code can also be found on this website: http://jsfiddle.net/magicramki/k9gda3cu/  If you do not want to go back all the way, you will need to stop the script. In order to do that, you will first need to define it as a variable:  var myVar=setInterval(function () { document.getElementById('see_older') .getElementsByClassName('content')[0].click(); }, 500);  Then to stop it, you will simply need to enter the following command:  window.clearInterval(myVar)  You can resume the script anytime by typing the first part again.

You can buy some sheetrock at a lumber yard or home improvement center (or maybe even pick up some free scraps). Cut it with a utility knife to size and screw pieces in place with dry wall screws to replace the crumbled plaster. You may have to remove more plaster to expose the studs, which are the best places to screw the sheetrock to (I'm assuming you are talking about lath (wooden strips) and plaster in your wall; if what's crumbling is sheetrock (hard plaster between two sheets of paper), then just cut out the bad parts with a utility knife, back to a stud. After you've screwed on the new sheetrock pieces, use joint compound to plaster up the gaps. If you've just got small holes, you can just use joint compound to fill them up. You could also just apply joint compound over big areas of lath, but I find for larger gaps that it works better to screw up a piece of sheetrock to cover most of the hole, then patch up the edges. If your crumbling wall is sheetrock, measure the thickness of it so you can buy the same thickness. If it's lathe and plaster, measure the thickness from the surface of the lathe to the surface of the plaster.Also note that joint compound  shrinks when it dries. Its best to apply it to the holes, smoothing with a putty knife, let it completely dry (a day), then do it again (it will have cracked and sunk in spots). Professionals also use joint tape, but this seems overkill since the repair will be hidden behind a baseboard. <SEP> How do I go about fixing holes in plaster walls?

Some people would suggest using that "plastic wood" wood putty to build it up but that stuff looks unnatural and you won't like the outcome. Here's an idea. Take off the door and use a plane or sander to make it square and even all the way around. Then re-hang it and you should have an even gap all the way around. You can then take a thin piece of wood (same type of wood, of course) in the right thickness to fill in the gaps. Cut it to the right length, glue it in place, secure it with a few tiny finish nails, sand it so it's flush with the rest of the door, then paint or stain to your heart's content. This is the short version of the process, but I think you get the idea. Don't use that wood putty/plastic wood stuff, it's messy and looks bad. Good Luck. <SEP> How do I fix my internal doors?

You've left out a bit of information, such as inground or above, type of equipment etc. I'll post my generic closing guide here for you.Ideally, your closing starts a week before you actually get down to putting the cover on. Get your water balanced chemically first. That week allows you to do this.On closing day: Vac the pool and drain it to just below the pool returns. They are typically the lowest point in the system. When drained to that point, add in a winterizing chemical kit (most pool shops sell them), they typically contain an algaecide, shock and sequestering agent . Remove ladders and rails. You may remove the diving board if you wish, or cover it in opaque plastic sheet and secure it. If you totally remove it,  place something over the diving board jig bolts and lube those bolts or tape with duct tape that jut up through the deck. This can prevent stubbed toes and saves the jig bolts from corrosion.You're done at the pool for the moment. Head over to your pool equipment. If this is a sand filtered pool, you ought to have done a backwash, during the draining process, to clean out the filter. If a D.E. pool, then the same applies to clean off the elements. You can remove them later for a thorough cleaning. If a cartridge filter, just remove the cartridge and clean at your leisure.For all filter types, there will be a drain plug, remove it and keep it out.Over to the pump. All inground pumps will have 2 plugs, one midway back on one side and one directly in front.All above ground pumps have a single one, located at the front, under the impellor housing. Remove them and place them in the pump basket along with your filter drain plug. It's a nice , safe place, that you won't lose them in, as you'll leave the pump basket right where it is. This next part all depends on your pool plumbing, you'll have to decide the best route as they are all plumbed differently and the many different ways to blow out lines would be a book unto itself. You'll need to tap into both the return and the suction lines. Typically for the returns, you disconnect a line between your filter and heater (if equipped) and for the suction, you can go directly in from the front of the pump, without disconnecting anything. Doing it this way, will allow you to blow all the water out of the heater, pool returns, any waterfall or fountain(if equipped) or attached spa. Same goes for the suction line for skimmer, in wall suction for a pool cleaner and attached spa suctions (if equipped). You can rent a line blower from a rent all or your local pool shop, or you can use a medium sized shop vac that has a blow feature. The shop vac hose is actually the same diameter as the inside diameter of most pool plumbing (1 1/2 inch) so it makes a good fit. Blow out the lines, until you only see a tiny dribble at the pool, both suction and return. Charge the line with plumber's antifreeze (not automotive) and blow that through to the pool, for all lines. When you see the dye colour of the antifreeze at the pool, it means that the antifreeze protection is sufficient. Plug with your telflon taped winter plugs, all lines ending at the pool. Put something squishable (empty chemical containers or an old partially filled inner tube) into the skimmer to protect it from freeze damage. Remove the pressure guages from the filter and put them in the pump basket with your equipment plugs.There are 3 basic types of pool heater, electric, gas and solar. You don't mention which you have, so I'll assume if you do have one, it's gas. Open the drain cocks on both sides of the heater header (you blew out all the water , when doing the lines, should just be a little anti freeze that dribbles out) and disconnect the pressure switch from it's compression fitting. No need to store it, just let it hang from it's electrical wires. Turn off both the gas valve on the interior and the gas feed line going to the heater.

The idle should be higher when you start a cold engine. After it warms up it should typically idle at 750 RPM.

the question is "is this an exhaust manifold or an intake?"each one has a different fix- exhaust -yes, may have a warped manifold- replace the gasket- if it leaks or leaks later on ir may be in need of a machine shop or new one. if its an intake i would have to assume it leaks air into the engine causing rough running, if thats not the problem I would assume that your leaking antifreeze and the only fix is to pull the intake and replace the gaskets. hope this helps - if not e-mail and let me know- Norm <SEP> how do I fix a manifold leak on a 93 lt1 z28 camaro?
To elaberate on what was said. IF you do not have a crossmember or steering arm in the way, then you are more than likely catching on the Crankshaft (it comes down about 3 inches into the oil pan) - or you are catching on the oil pump pickup tube (it comes down almost 5 inchs into the oil pan)You MUST lift the motor high enough that the pan will come DOWN to clear these items - WARNING if you move the pickup tube on the oil pump / or bend it / you will NOT get oil when you re-start the car - that pickup tube sets just above the bottom of the oil pan - about 1/2 inches from the bottom.WARNING - if you do not watch what you are doing you will break the distributor on the fire wall, or break the exhaust from bending them, or break the transmission from the lift.a couple of pic's below showing how far the crank and oil pickup sticks out from the block <SEP> How do I remove a oil pan from a 1968 Impala (327ci)?

Front Wheel Bearing and Hub ReplacementTools RequiredJ 42129 Wheel Hub Remover (this is a fairly generic tool you can rent from some parts stores - you may or may not need this tool - you won't know for sure until you remove the hub nut as outlined below)Removal ProcedureRaise and support the vehicle.Remove the tire and wheel.Disconnect the wheel speed sensor electrical connector (2), if equipped.  Remove the wheel speed sensor electrical connector from the bracket, if equipped. Remove the front wheel drive shaft nut. Insert a drift or flat-bladed tool into the caliper and rotor to prevent from turning. Remove the brake rotor. (Removing the dront driveshaft nut is going to be the hardest part of the repair.  It is a large nut - 36mm if I remember correctly - and torqued to over 140 ft lbs) Use 3 wheel nuts in order to attach the J 42129 to the wheel bearing/hub.Use the J 42129 in order to push the wheel drive shaft out of the wheel bearing/hub. (often times the drive shaft will push out of the hub with only hand pressure - the older and more rust on it, the more likely you are to need the tool to overcome the rust) Remove and DISCARD the wheel bearing/hub bolts. Remove the J 42129 from the hub. Important: Ensure that the wheel drive shaft outer seal/boot is not damaged. Remove the wheel bearing/hub and splash shield-noting the position of the shield for re-installation. Installation ProcedureInstall the wheel bearing/hub with the splash shield as noted during removal.Caution: These fasteners MUST be replaced with new fasteners anytime they become loose or are removed. Failure to replace these fasteners after they become loose or are removed may cause loss of vehicle control and personal injury.Install NEW wheel bearing/hub bolts. Tighten Tighten the NEW wheel bearing/hub bolts to 130 N·m (96 lb ft).Install the brake rotor and caliper.Install the front wheel drive shaft nut. Insert a drift on a flat-bladed tool into caliper and rotor to prevent the rotor from turning. Tighten Tighten the front wheel drive shaft nut to 160 N·m (118 lb ft).Important: Ensure that the connector clip engages the bracket properly. Install the wheel speed sensor electrical connector to the bracket, if equipped.  Connect the wheel speed sensor electrical connector (2), if equipped. Install the tire and Lower the vehicle.

dig a deep enough trench.  at least two feet deep.  nice and narrow.  if u're getting a backhoe tell the operator to bring the smallest bucket cuz it needs to be deep, not wide.  dig deeper if you plan to do other excavationsline the bottom of your trench with about a foot of sand.  we usually use crushed stone dust but sand is cheaper, less messy and works just fine.  the sand is so you don't backfill with rocks that might damage the gas linelay your gas line in therebury in more sandcover the sand with a yellow tape down the length of the trench so if anyone is ever digging they will see the tape and know you put something there.&#92;make sure it's deep enough you have room for 4 inches of soil on top or asphalt or whatever you plan on doing <SEP> how do I bury gas lines under ground?

hey bud you need to be a little more specific such as how do you install switched receptacles or how do you switch something pluged to a recepticle or if its new or old instillation.... but i am guessing that you want to know how to switch a recepticle... there is a tab on eather side if you want to keep top always hot and switch bottom brake the tab on the sides between the darker terminals if you want the hole thing switchable then keep tabs intact.. now here is your options you can run 12/3 with ground or 12/2 with ground. if you are running switched/hot combination you will need the 12/3 with ground.... tie the black before the switch in to the incomeing power,    then take a small piece of wire and wire nut the small piece to the incomeing line and hook it to the switch, hook the red to the other side of the switch...  tie all the whites and grounds together..... run to receptacle....on the darker screws hook black to the top red to the bottom (red is switched) .... and hook the white to the recepticle.... if you want to switch the hole thing... forgit about breaking tabs just hook incomeing black to switch tie whites together and grounds put outgoing black on the other screw of the switch... run to recepticle black to darker white to lighter ground it and go....KEEP in mind check the amperage that the switch was ment to hold EX. 15A,20A sw.  or more if needed (buy the 20 for most applications)take a look at this...

I had the same problem except I had the list of about 15 contacts that I wanted to add as contacts and add as a group.  I did not want to have hover over each name and individually add them and then add them all to a contact list after.  I found a quick solution, here is what I did:  Beside the list of recipients I pressed the 'show details' down arrow.  Then I copied the list of recipient emails.  I went to the contacts view for Gmail. Clicked Add to Contacts and pasted the emails in.  At the left hand side I expanded the list of contact groups and clicked "New Group...".  I followed the steps to make a new group.  Then I clicked the "Add to contact list" button and pasted in the list of contacts again.  Done! <SEP> In Gmail, how do I create a contact from a recipient of an email?

These can be a pain on the 96 and newer.  It is located just to the drivers side of the distributor at the back of the engine.  You may want to disconnect the negative battery cable or the ECM-B fuse in the fuse box under the hood as the oil pressure switch has 12v going to it all the time(it provides power to the fuel pump when oil pressure is present as a backup power source to the fuel pump relay).

you first nedd to assess the condition of the bodywork, does the paint have any bubbles ? is there any corrosion that needs repairing such as wheel areches etc ( you dont say what the vehicle is and the age) asuming there is no serious corrosion then you have a lot of sanding to do, if the paintwork and bodywork is in good condition then you need to basically take the shine off the paintwork and ideally coat it with etch primer, the trouble is not knowing what the paint is on the vehicle as some modern paints react with older ones, if this is the case you will need to go back to bare metal to cure the bubbling effect this has, the process is not complicated but it is time consuming, from bare metal you would using body filler (mix in proportions of  filler = size of a golf ball, hardner = size of a pea) you apply the filler to the damaged area and allow to set hard, using as fine a grade of production paper as posssible (less scratches to get rid of later) you sand the repait until it is flat with the panel surface (ifi its curved use something like a piece of plastic pipe, if flat use a rubbing block) you keep repeating this process until the repair is unoticble when you run your hand over it, all repairs must be as good as that.  Next you prime the area using a fine dust coat so that and high or low spots can be seen and repaired this can be done by using a filler putty, this coat needs to be rubbed down with wet and dry (use soap as well it stops the paper clogging) and this process is repeated until all the repairs are complete, then if you wish you can begin applying coats of primer rubbing down with a fine paper in between (soap again) and finally panel wipe (solvent so take care) and tak rag the surface ready for painting, i reccomend several coats of primer to give a deep finish <SEP> How do I prep a car for spraying? Interested in cutting down the cost of spraying a car by doing the prep work myself, can anybody help me, do you have bodywork experience?  I find it hard to find information on the net regarding prep work for car bodys so any help would be appreciated.  Thank you!
You could also try to purchase the product that clean scratches from reading glasses ( I just can't recall the name of it).  Alot of companies, like vision-wear probably sell it.

danknow is right, it depends on the tank design.  I too worked in a gas station and had to dip tanks, but there we knew the size of the tank and were able to use the right chart with the right stick.  The only way to know for sure is to find out which company manufactured the tank and retreive a chart and perhaps a measuring stick from them.  Good luck. <SEP> How do I determine the remaining gallons in a 1000 inground fuel tank? There must be a chart available that converts inches to gallons for these tanks.
If you go to any autoparts store like AutoZone, they will do it for you.  Otherwise just purchase a Cross Iron, it has four of the most common tire bolt (called lug nuts) sizes.  However, they take up a lot of space and if your in a saturn you don't have an overwhelming amount of space to give, so go to AutoZone and have them find the right tire iron (it's a small L-shape).  If they don't have it just go to another place.Furthermore you might want to get a "cheat-bar" too.  It's just a hollow metal tube that goes over your tire iron and extends the length of it, therefore it give you more leverage incase your lug nutz are really tight.  I'm a strong guy and I still need one once in a while and it doens't take up much space if you put it side by side with your tire iron.Oh yeah, and like the other guys said, unless you lost yours, you should have one that came with the car. <SEP> how can i figure out what size of a tool (& what tool) 2 tighten up the bolts on my tires? it is a 91 saturn..

if you have lingering smell of sewage in your home - the first thing to do is to make sure that none of your plumbing traps have evaporated.  Traps are designed to always have a level of water in them in order to prevent sewer gases from travelling up into the home.Go to each shower, tub & sink and run the water for a few seconds.  Additionally, if you have a toilet which has no water in it, yet is still hooked up to the plumbing, pour water into the toilet bowl until there is water sitting in the toilet bowl.  This will ensure that the trap will be filled.If a fixture (sink, tub, shower, toilet) goes unused for a certain amount of time, the water in the trap will eventually evaporate thus making for a clear path for the sewer gases to make their way into the bathroom, kitchen, etc.  If you still have the smell of sewer gases after doing the above, have a plumber check your sewer system outside, if you have a private system (non-public).  You also might have a filled septic tank which needs emptied.  Logically, this will eventually occur for everyone who has a septic tank since all collection tanks eventually need emptied.  If all your in-house plumbing is working correctly and your septic tank is not full and backed-up, then you should not be encountering sewer gases.  Also check your garbage disposal:  certain rotting foods in the bottom of sink drains tend to smell like a sewer.  Again, do a good cleaning and regular cleaning of all your drains to avoid this.  Also, unless you have a working garbage disposal, do not let solid food make it's way down your drain.  Food items can easily get stuck and thus start the rotting process while it's still within smelling range. <SEP> How can i get rid of the smell of sewage? Er no hands of mine are going to unblock that?
How big of an area got soaked?  This answer assumes a fairly large area (10x10 or larger)....Pull it up.  You need to dry the carpet padding too.  You need to rent carpet fans.   Most experts will tell you that if the padding is soaked through and through.... replace it with new or you risk mold and mildew.Place every fan you that can get your hands on to run air through the room and out a window.   Make sure you have another window across the house open for cross breeze.Bonus points for rolling in a dehumidifier too.   Empty the drawer often!Good luck!BTW- you can often contact local carpet companies for this service... and they'll be happy to sell you new padding too :) <SEP> How do you dry carpet after it gets soaked by water?
Usually you smell gas first, if only faintly as apparently you have. Some of the gas line connections or the line itself eventually rust through and the gas just wets the outside of the line right around where the rust spots are. So follow the lines as suggested above, and look for wet spots. The fuel vapor recovery system in your car might also be responsible for a gas smell if it's not working properly. Fuel tanks rust through eventually and start leaching gas also. Gas leaks are dangerous as you know, so get it fixed ASAP. <SEP> How would I find a fuel leak in my car?
Start the honda. Find or buy a 3' length of new fuel hose. Stick one end in your ear and snoop around the intake system with the other end listen for any pronounced "hisssssssing...". [Warren Bain] I was able to isolate a vacuum leak with a mechanic's stethoscope with the probe removed and only using the tubing to get very close to the gasket and follow the contour of the manifold. You can also modify the stethoscope for locating vacuum leaks by replacing the probe with a length of plastic hose or fuel line. Spraying With Liquid. Another trick, for small leaks such as loose intake manifolds or shrunken injector seals, is to spray them with carb cleaner. This will temporarily seal a leak and a rough idle will smooth out for 10-15 seconds: you will hear the change in idle rpm. <SEP> how can I check for vacuum leaks on my bike (honda vtx)? after rejetting my honda vtx, it now chokes when I turn on the throttle.

Run a hot wire from your fuse box to the switch mounted on the dash. Then either run the wire from the switch to the horn relay, or to the horn itself. Before I was to do that, I would check the horn itself, to be sure it works. Run a jumper wire from the positive battery terminal and touch it to the spot where the wire would plug into the horn. The horn should blow. If not the horn itself is bad, no wiring bypass will help. Also check the horn relay. Usually it is the horn or the relay, not the switch that goes bad. <SEP> how do i hardwire a horn?

The type of tile can make a difference in the way you tile. However, with all tile.  You need to make sure your surface is level.  If not there is a product you can get at Home Depot to fix it.  Once is dries, sand it down so that everything is level.  Then you're set to mortar you tiles in.  Follow that direction on the bag.  Rent a wet-saw to cut large tiles.  After you get your tiles set, you'll need to wait a least a day before grouting.  ONce again, follow the directions on the bag.  Make sure yo get all the tools yo need ahead of time so you don't wast time driving back and forth to the store.  Home Depot sells an all in one bucket that will have everything.

Oh, I got ur point. Cause: Pot holes are caused due to entry of water or poorly graded materials used.Remedy: Wait for dry weather. Now dig the area surrounding pot holes in a rectangular shape upto the depth of soil containing excess moisture. Fill it back with suitable layers of soil containing optimum moisture at which maximum degree of compaction can be achieved and well graded gravel duly compacting each layer with suitable means. Seal the top layer with bituminous concrete layer. <SEP> How should I fill potholes in a gravel driveway? I live in a rental house in Washington state.

It rains all the time, so it's got to be something pretty waterproof.Putting loose gravel in the hole works for about ten minutes, and then cars kick it all out.
Rear brakes can be a pain, especially if they're drum brakes and not disc.  First thing to do would be to go out and get a Hayne's Manual for your car and it's year.  This book will cover the brakes specifically for your car, and will include pictures, step by step, and the reassembly.  They also make a Brake Manual that covers all kinds of brakes.  It's a little more detaild and includes even more pictures.  Both books can be found at any auto parts store and are normally only $15.  Disc brakes should require no more than a socket set and maybe some allen wrenches.  It's normally only two bolts on the caliper.  Drum brakes will require some specialized tools, but they're very inexpensive.  If you've never done it before, drum brakes work with multiple springs on the inside that have to be replaced in specific order.  You will need to give yourself some time to figure it out, and even better, a camera to take a picture of the other side (it gets old running back and forth to make sure you're doing it right since you'll be doing one wheel at a time; obviously one will still be assembled).  The books will help a lot though.Disc brakes can take as little as 15 minutes to replace, drums as much as a whole day. <SEP> how to install rear brakes on 1993 mazda 929?

Judge the severity of the scratch and start with the finest grit sanding pad to remove the scratch. Rub over scratch in a straight line to remove it. Periodically switch rubbing direction 90°. Be sure all of the scratch is removed. If this first step takes too long, try the next heavier grit sanding pad. To minimize dust during sanding, wet the surface. Rinse pad periodically to clean residue. Clean top with water. Select next lighter grit and repeat process. Rub over a larger area to blend in sanding. Continue process using successively finer grits until desired gloss level is achieved. for more info check out: <SEP> how do I get scratches out of corian counter tops?
There is no provision for adjusting the clutch since it is operated hydraulically. <SEP> How do I adjust the clutch pedal on an '88 Jeep Wrangler? I have a 1988 Jeep Wrangler who recently had the tranny rebuilt.  Everything worked great.  Then, I put on some new pedal pads (gas, brake, and clutch pedals--better grip when driving with wet feet) and a floor mat.  Now, I have to press the pedal *into* the floor to get the clutch to disengage/engage.  I'm wearing a hole into the floor mat because of how far down I have to push it! ...and a lot of times it actually gets STUCK on the floor mat, which is dangerous.I'd really like to adjust my clutch *just a little* so I can still drive it with the accessories I put on.  Cars I've had in the past had simple ways to to do this...but I can't see how to do it on my Wrangler.  I've tried looking in a repair manual and online but haven't found anything yet.Does anyone know how to adjust it?  I would think there *has* to be a way...Thanks,Dan

The only real way to learn is hands on. What you can do is go to a community college and take a few classes. Also try and get a job in a repair shop even if its only cahnging oil for a while. That way during the slow times you can try and spend time with the mechanics and give them anytype of help you can. you may be taking wheels of for the mechanic so he can due a brake inspection and before you know you are doing the brake inspections while he does other work and just keep trying to get in there.

i think you are experincing caliper slap. you need to have your brakes done..if its that wore that it has enough space to "clunk" it is wore. and common sence tells me if one side is that wore...the other side wont be far behind. there are a few diff ways to do it, you can replace all the hardware...or get the spacers...no yours is not the first like this so they make a lil spacer to go in there to take up the extra space.i think the fact you put air in your tire at the same time has little or nothing to do with it....BUT i would look at the front end upper/lower ball joints, pitman arm, drag link, inner and outer tie rod ends, check your bearings  repack em.    what im saying is if you dont know your way around the front end of a truck...take it somplace that does or you could end up spending ALOT more later. i just had one where a chick lost her lower ball joint on the freeway...luckly she dident kill herself or somone else. cost her bout 100 bucks for the ball joint and 1500 more in fixing the repairs of it coming unglued at 75 mph! <SEP> How do I adjust the front disc brakes on a Dodge Dakota?

Update:  The following is an answer from 2011. Obviously the right answer changed from that time as there is a better answer in 2014. Please note the 3 year difference before voting on the answer.  Keeping for archival reasons only, original answer:  I have checked the related Google Groups and Support threads. Obviously, it's not supported (and looks like no soon plan to be, although not 100% sure about this one).  The way I do now is export to Excel and apply the filter there, then find a likely unique value (or repeats few times) in the sheet to correlate the row in the Google Spreadsheet (by finding it in the Google sheet) and apply the required modifications. Not optimal, still hoping for per-user fllter support. <SEP> Multi user filter issue in Google Spreadsheets

lol, I had a light come on my dash that said "service engine" and I thought it was the check engine light.  I just had to turn the car off, press and hold the trip meter button and start it with it held and wait 10 more seconds and the light went out.If it's really the check-engine light, you may have a problem.  These problems range from having the gas cap on loose to a major computer-engine interface problem.I have a scanner to see and diagnose those problems but you may have to go to a dealer to get yours.  First url below is a link to the trouble codes.  To see the codes do the following:"When the Check Engine warning light has been reported on, turn the ignition on, move the front passenger seat to the rear position and observe the LED on the front of the ECU. The LED indicates a system failure code by blinking frequency. The ECU LED can indicate any number of simultaneous component problems by blinking separate codes, one after another.If output indicates CODE 4, 11, 15, 16 or exceeds 17, count the number of blinks again. If the indicator is in fact, blinking these codes, substitute a known-good ECU and recheck If the indication goes away, replace the original ECU."I'm guessing that you don't have a "known good ECU" anywhere so that means go to the dealer or your local trusted genius friend auto mechanic.Hopefully you find what's wrong by reading the ECU (Electronic Control Unit) blinks and flashes and this information will steer you in the right direction. <SEP> how to reset the check engen light on a 1994 honda civic ex?

the easiest way to tell if a fuel pump is working or not is to have someone else turn the key to the on postion but not actually turn it, put your head down by the gas tank and listen when the other person turns the key to on you should hear a whining sound for a couple of seconds at most if you should get stuck somewhere and you can't hear the fuel pump start when you turn the key to on, you can try kicking the middle of the gas tank which generally where the fuel pump is . sometimes the pump will jiggle around enough to allow it to work again. caution should be used if you have a metal gas tank because if it's rusted you may put your foot through it if you kick it hard enough <SEP> How do you check to see if your fuel pump is broken on a 95 ford f-series truck?

Some videos (like the Vevo ones) get streamed; I haven't figured out how to save them yet.  But for the bulk of videos, they get saved to the computer's temporary folder until the video is navigated away from. On a Linux or Mac OS X computer, it's relatively easy to find and copy the temporary file elsewhere (renaming it to a .flv if it is a Flash video).  On Windows, the file's locked, so you need to use something like HoboCopy to copy it, which requires administrator rights and command-line usage. In places where you don't have administrator rights, like a computer lab, I launch a logging proxy ( Fiddler2 's lightweight and easy) to intercept all HTTP traffic, but this slows down all your browsing while it's capturing.

1st althought the first answer is ok. There are some things you need to know.ACID will wear the tank even A little bit will do this.I have been a plumber for 20yrs and I wish you would have said if it was on a well or city water but anyways.there is not real way to get into the tank and scrape it.And I dont know how handy you are but if you arego to your local plumbing supply house and ask them for descaler Tell them what your doing they will know what you need.Shut the water and elec off to the tank and remove the cold pipe from the tank.Pull out the dip tude its about 36inchs or so Depending on what kind you have.Get a 4tf Pc pf copper and drill holes in the pipe only on 3 ft of the pipe SMALL HOLES about 50 to 6o of them.Buy the connector so you can hook up to a hoseAnd buy A good size funnelDrain the HWT at the bottom there is a hose bib open it and drain in.( at the local HD store buy a drill pump About 5 bucks it comes with 2 pc of 5 foot hosesMix the product you got from the dealer mix with water Put a 2 gallon bucket under hose bib pour mix into funnel (funnel is in top of copper pipe u slide into the cold side of tank.With the small pump 1 side of the hose in the bucket 1 side in the funnel Use cordless drill and start the drill up. This will cause the pump to move the mix in 1 big circel And it will shoot out all the little holes in the copper pipe. do this for 5 min wait 20 min and do this again. When you are done hook up hose to pipe and turn on the hose and wash the tank really good to remove any acid in the tank or dirt. then put back together.This is a little bit of work though. And if your tank has this problem then your pipes do too.You should have your water tested and see if a filter system could help you out or a softner. ( Things like this keep money in my pocket this is a common problem) But when a tank gets to a point like this  and its bad Its better to change the tank check the water and do what you can like a filter ect.(( Always remember with any HWT if its a well system every 3 months to 6 months Hook up a hose to the hose bib on the bottom of the tank and turn it on this will cause water to rush into the tank and out the hose when clear water comes out of the hose its clean.MOST Hwts that go bad is cause so much dirt is in the bottom of the tank and it had ate its way through the tank.A little bit of maintiance will save you 1000's in the long run.Also Do you know for sure this is what is in your tank? Alot of times homeowners think this is what it is and its not. Make sure you know what it is before you try to correct the problem.If you need more info and would like my help drop me a line at kos101@yahoo.comGoodluck <SEP> how to quickly remove scaling deposits from inside a electric hot water tank?
First look at the Clutch on the Compressor, see if it is engaging-  you look, while someone turns the A/c on and off with the car running-   If clutch is ok and engaging,  Add Freon -If it is not engaging check the Fuse, in USA you can buy a kit to do this-  but first determine what coolant you need,  R134 is in most all late model cars-  R-12 in older models,   R-12 is banned in USA.

First question: does it have one outlet for the string or two? Have you been able to take the spool off the head? The spool will have some sort of anchor hole through which you thread the string. Cut a piece of line about 20 feet long, thread one end through the hole and pull it even so that you have two equal lengths. The wind both pieces at one time around the spool. There should be an arrow on the spool telling you which way to wind. Wind the string snugly but not tight. Try to lay the wraps down side-by side rather than on top of each other...sort of like a fishing reel. Obviously youll need to wind on top of wraps eventually. Try to "stack" them. Finally, and this is where youll probably go nuts, line the spool up with the head, pull the ends through the exit grommets in the head and push everything back together making sure line remains in the spool, not under it against the head. Cut any excess string that might extend past the guard.This is not the sort of thing that lends itself easily to this format. Most line trimmers work pretty much the same.

The previous responder was close, but just a little short of the finish.  I repair this stuff for a living, so I've seen a few of these things, and I've never seen one that just pulls off the shaft.   After you have the screw out, (he was correct about that part,), the chuck  will unscrew, probably the same way as the screw came out.  If it's a reversible drill motor, then the chuck should be left handed threads as well.  If it doesn't break loose easily, and they seldom do, then take an allen wrench, as big as you can get into the open chuck,  and tighten down the chuck jaws on it.  You may  have to hit the end of the allen wrench with a hammer a few times to get the threads to break free.  The new one should install easier. <SEP> How do you remove the chuck from a sears electric hand drill?

You don't.There are two options. 1/ replace the entire line ( requires a lot of digging)2/ Have a pool pro pressure test the line. He can do a leak location during the test and tell you within 6 inches or so where the leak is located. Even under 6 inches of concrete and 3 feet down. (less digging and cheaper than replacing the entire line) Then it's just a matter of digging out an area one man can work in, down to the break and inserting a coupling in the line. Typically, the hole in the deck can be just 2 feet by 2 feet in most cases and easily patched when the repair is done. The colour won't match if this is a concrete deck , I'm afraid, but there's no getting around that. Typically, the pressure test and leak location costs anywhere between 50 - 100 dollars depending on how long it takes them due to the nature of the pool and it's equipment. The actual repair, you could do yourself, but it's back breaking, requires working in a tight space, be good with basic hand tools and have a spotter ready to pull you out if you initiate a cave in with your head down that hole. If you get someone in to do the repair, the rate usually starts at about 200 dollars (unless it's a line just under dirt) and can easily top 600 if it's in a bad spot. If there's no way you want to cut the deck (like a stamped coloured concrete deck) then tunneling, when the leak is located is an option, but VERY expensive. I've dug a 12 foot one once under a garden that couldn't be disturbed to the leak and the bill came to over 1200 dollars. <SEP> how to fix a leak in a 2" Pvc pipe arround a swiming pool without a trench?

Your problem with moss is due to compacted soil,( nowhere for water to drain down) your lawn needs to have all the moss raked out, after this it will probably look rubbish, buy an "airater: from your local hardwear store, failing that use a fork to make holes in your lawn where the moss was growing prolific, next mix some lawn sand and peat and sweep it into the holes using a stiiff brush, this will almost certainly cure your problem. <SEP> how do you get rid of moss in a shady lawn ?

The best way is to buy an auto manual from your local auto parts store. But, I will try to tell you how. You need special tools. You need a "panel" remover to remove the door panel.

Some people prefer to use a sprayer (like a garden sprayer) because its easier to stain the ballusters but you can end up wasting a lot of stain that way and also cause puddles on the decking. Use a brush or roller and apply just like you would paint. If you are re-staining, ideally you'd want to take a pressure washer to it but if you don't have one, give it a good scrub with a stiff bristle or wire brush. Make sure to THOROUGHLY stir the stain, and stir it every 10-15 minutes otherwise some of the stain will be like water and the bottom will be thicker than paint. <SEP> how do you stain a deck?

wear a dust mask first. and get your self a lot of strong garbage bags. I would start by hitting the wall with a crowbar to break the plaster and (wearing gloves) start to break off the plaster with your hands and use the crobar if you need to. I would remove all the plaster first then the lath or wooden strips. this process will just make the clean up a little easier to mannage. you can also dampen the walls with water to limit the dust. If you do it in a methodical mannner it wont be such a bitch to clean up. and when you start pulling of the lath as you are removing it lay them in piles so it will be easier to bundle up for removal. Good luck <SEP> How do i gut plaster walls?
Sorry to say but both previous answers DO NOT give the correct procedure for ignition switch replacement.  The ignition switch is mounted on the upper side of the steering column between the firewall and dashboard.  The steering column can be unbolted from the dash and lowered to gain easier access.  The wiring connector unplugs off the switch and two small screws removed and the switch is in your hand.  Fit the new switch on the "L" shaped actuator rod and replace screws.  The switch has slotted mounting points so it can be adjusted to the correct "OFF" position to match the lock cylinder position.  A shop should charge about 1 to 1.5 hours labor to do it. <SEP> how do i change the ignition switch on a 1985 chevy truck?

First open the trunk, let the gas vapor vent out For an hour or two, overnight is even better, VERY DANGEROUS ! Gas vapors in the trunk, then you brake, and the lights come on the tail lights in the trunk, spark, ka-boom ! then put some kitty litter on the carpet where the gas spilled, and work it into the carpet with a small block of wood or brick, let is stand for an hour or so to absorb, then vacuum up the kitty litter, KEEPING the vacuum way away from the trunk (electric motors make sparks). Put a big open box of Baking soda in the trunk, you can even sprinkle some on the carpet, leave on, vacuum up later. If you must use the car, drive with the trunk slightly open for venting of the fumes, keep some rope, and something to prevent the trunk from slamming shut while you drive. <SEP> how do i get auto gas (spilled) out of carpet? gas spilled in trunk carpet in car
Your truck has IFS, independent front suspension. The most you can get from the suspension is about 1.5inch lift, by adjusting the torsion bars to max. This is not recommended because of the added torsional stress on the bars, and your ride will be rough. You can gain a couple inches doing a body lift, again not recommended due to complications with the steering angles, brake lines, cooler lines, etc... and your bumper wont line up with the body, which looks goofy.On a brighter note... you can lift the rear of the truck easily. Adding extra leafs can gain a few inches and increase the load capacity. You can use lift blocks, Max 3inch or you will get axle hop, also this must be done with correctly designed parts to be safe. Finally, you can put large springs in, which is your best bet.If you do it... Do it right.

I have to agree with the other posters.  If you want an accurate assessment you will need to call an appraiser.  A Realtor can give you an idea of what similar homes in your area have recently sold for or are currently listed at.  The websites out there are just crap.  They use loan info to give you a value.  My house was bought with cash,  one website (zillow) values it with the foreclosure amount of the previous owner from 2 years ago (nothing to do with current market conditions) and the same website shows our neighbors house (paid 1/2 cash and financed 1/2) for the amount financed as the value of the home.  Another website shows my house being 30 years older than it actually is, bringing the value down.  None of the websites have the square footage correct.

well if the engine runs and you want to set the timing then you will need a timing light, first connect your timing light to the battery and the number one spark plug wire, clean off your timing marks on the harmonic balancer and timing indicator and outline with chalk or something that is visible this is just  a suggestion and is not required, loosen the distributor clamp about a quarter turn and then start the engine, point your timing light at the marks and see where the lines are on the balancer and your indicator, I do not know the specification on your car but 0 degrees or slightly advanced is generally a good starting point. If your car backfires or when the starter engages and the engine turns over real slow then that is a good indication that your timing is off or a fault somewhere in the ignition system. <SEP> how to set timming on a 1979 nova V6?

Older homes often have receptacles and fixtures that are ungrounded, and many local codes do not require that they be rewired so they're grounded. Still, grounding is worth adding to your system because it adds protection against electrical shock. Grounding provides a third path for electricity to travel along, so if there is a leak of any sort, it will flow into the earth rather than into the body of a person who touches a defective fixture, appliance, or tool.An electrical system is grounded with a grounding rod driven at least 8 feet into the ground outside the house or connected to a cold water pipe. Each individual branch circuit must be grounded as well, either with a separate wire that leads to the neutral bar of the service panel or with metal sheathing that runs without a break from each outlet to the panel. (In theory, electrical outlets can be grounded individually, but this is impractical.) <SEP> How do you ground a home? I am looking for details about a "ufred" method.

Most baseboard Water heaters have small bleeders at the end of the heaters, some you can use a screwdriver, and some you need a small adjustable wrench.If you have more than one heater on that water line, "(this is called a zone)" You could have two,three, or four zones heating your house. This is done for efficiency and to reduce the problem of air in the system. You need to start at the heater at the end of that zone, and work back to the supply, {Hot water tank or boiler}.

I think the average cost of a locksmith is about $50 to $75 in the US to unlock your car.I would probably go that way rather than breaking a window.Depending on the car, you might be able to get into it without breaking a window, but on the modern cars today, they are designed so it is tough to get in without a lot of damage.But that is something only you can decide because it could cost a heck of a lot more than the cost of the locksmith if you do inadvertantly break a glass. <SEP> how to get your keys out of a locked vehicle?
Did you try to use a paper (brown) grocery bag, and an iron?     You put the bag on the carpet then iron on a low setting, usually the wax will liquify then soak into the bag.

THE USE A THERMOMETER, USUALLY A 1" DIAL TYPE AND AVAILABLE IN COOKWARE DEPARTMENT AT STORES. PIERCE THE POINTED END INTO THE EXHAUST DUCT.  READ THE TEMPERATURE THAT THE THERMOSTAT GOES UP TO AND DOWN TO A FEW TIMES.  THIS SHOULD CORRESPOND TO THE TEMPERATURE IMPRINTED ON THE THERMOSTAT FLANGE. FOR EXAMPLE THE FLANGE MARKED 180-2 WOULD MEAN OFF AT 180 FOR A HIGH AND IT WOULD GO BACK DOWN TO 160 AND TURN THE ELEMENT OR GAS VALVE BACK ON.  ANOTHER HI-LIMIT SENSOR MIGHT BE MARKED 250-5.

The tools you need:Stirring implementPlasterSpatulasSandpaperPaintSpongeSelect a spatula that's slightly wider than the hole you are filling. Also select one or two smaller spatulas you can use for touch-up work.Preparing the plaster: Open the plaster. If the plaster is in a can, use a screwdriver or an old table knife to pry off the lid. Use a wooden stick or spoon to stir the plaster. Make sure it's smooth, with no lumps or liquid. Applying the plaster to the hole: Use the spatula to spread plaster over the hole. Spread the plaster in only one direction, making sure to spread it beyond the boundaries of the hole.  After the plaster is dry, you can use a smaller spatula to touch up any areas that are not completely filled in. After the plaster is completely dry, use the sandpaper to lightly sand the surface. Make sure the plaster is nice and smooth right out to the edge of the hole and beyond.Painting the area: Using a sponge that matches the surface of the wall, practice dabbing paint on the cardboard. Keep practicing until you can duplicate the texture of the wall.  Use the same sponge (or sponges) to dab paint over the patch. Make sure you match the texture of the surrounding wall.  You can go back over the paint either while it's wet or after it dries. Try to get the texture just right. <SEP> How do I repair a hole in the wall?

I don't know how much there is out there for the late model Malibus.  You should've put what year it is too.

Air conditioning systems are closed systems, so they should never need recharging.  If it does, it means there's a leak.  You'll pretty much have to take it to a repair shop/dealership.  They add freon, with a 2003 it'll probably take synthetic, which is a little more expensive.  If you have a warranty still, this should be covered.  A good place will add dye, so that they can trace the leak.  If it's just a small leak, the recharge may last a couple of years.  If it's bigger, in a few weeks they'll want to look at it again, and search for the leak using a blacklight to detect the dye. <SEP> How do I recharge the air on my 2003 Honda Element?

You would picture a clock with its face toward the floor. Then if you have the fan running in its slowest mode, you can watch the fan blades and see if they turn clockwise (the same direction the hands of a clock turn) or counterclockwise (the opposite direction the hands of a clock turn).It would have to be considered 'face-down' because the best way to tell if something is turning in a certain direction is to look at it head-on. It wouldn't be 'head-on' if you had to consider it as facing the ceiling. <SEP> How do you tell if a ceiling fan is turning clockwise? Seriously.  When you are determining if a ceiling fan is turning clockwise, do you picture a clock with its face toward the floor or a clock with its face toward the ceiling?  Surprisingly, most people I ask say they picture a clock with its face up toward the ceiling.  This seems completely wrong to me.The question is important (well, kind of) because ceiling fan instructions say the fan should be turning clockwise in one season versus another to cool the room properly.

I don't know what you've used, but what's on the floor is probably polyurethane, which yellows with age. Have you used a paint stripper? I would think that would work.

My last attempt was muriatic acid in a small area which did nothing.  I desperately need help.

GENERAL CLEAN-UP PROCEDURES Identify and correct the moisture source Clean, disinfect, and dry the moldy area Bag and dispose any material that has moldy residues, such as rags, paper, leaves, or debris. What can I save? What should I toss? Substances that are porous and can trap molds, such as paper, rags, wallboard, and rotten wood should be decontaminated and thrown out. Harder materials such as glass, plastic, or metal can be kept after they are cleaned and disinfected. Ultimately, it is critical to remove the source of moisture first, before beginning remedial action, since mold growth will return shortly if an effected area becomes re-wetted. Removal of Moldy Materials After fixing the moisture source and removing excess moisture, the cleanup can begin: Wear gloves when handling moldy materials Remove porous materials (examples: ceiling tiles, sheetrock, carpeting, wood products) Carpeting can be a difficult problem -- drying does not remove the dead spores. If there is heavy mold, disposal of the carpet should be considered Bag and discard the moldy substances Allow the area to dry 2 or 3 days If flooded, remove all sheetrock to at least 12 inches above the high water mark. Visually inspect the wall interior and remove any other intrusive molds. (This step may have to be carried out by a licensed contractor). CAUTION: Spores are easily released when moldy material is dried out. Soap Cleanup Before disinfecting contaminated areas, clean the areas to remove as much of the mold (and food it is growing on) as possible. Wear gloves when doing this cleanup Use a non-ammonia soap or detergent, or a commercial cleaner, in hot water, and scrub the entire area affected by the mold Use a stiff brush or cleaning pad on block walls or uneven surfaces Rinse clean with water. A wet/dry vacuum is handy for this. Disinfect Surfaces Wear gloves when using disinfectants After thorough cleaning and rinsing, disinfect the area with a solution of 10% household bleach (e.g., 1½ cup bleach per gallon of water). Using bleach straight from the bottle will not be more effective Never mix bleach with Ammonia - the fumes are toxic For spraying exterior large areas, a garden hose and nozzle can be used When disinfecting a large structure, make sure the entire surface is wetted (floors, joists, and posts) Avoid excessive amounts of runoff or standing bleach Let disinfecting areas dry naturally overnight -- this extended time is important to kill all the mold. CAUTION: Bleach fumes can irritate the eyes, nose, and throat, and damage clothing and shoes. Make sure the working area is ventilated well. Can cleaning up mold be hazardous to my health? Yes. Exposure to mold can occur during the cleaning stage. Mold counts are typically 10 to 1000 times higher than background levels during the cleaning of mold damaged materials. Take steps to protect your health during cleanup: When handling or cleaning moldy materials, consider using a mask or respirator to protect you from breathing airborne spores. Respirators can be purchased from hardware stores; select one for particle removal (sometimes referred to as a N95 or TC-21C particulate respirator). Respirators are not as effective removing bleach fumes, so minimize your exposure when using bleach or other disinfectants. Wear protective clothing that is easily cleaned or discarded Use rubber gloves Try cleaning a small test patch of mold first. If you feel that this adversely affected your health, you should consider paying a licensed contractor or professional to carry out the work Ask family members or bystanders to leave areas when being cleaned. Work over short time spans and rest in a fresh air location. Air your house out well during after the work CAUTION: Never use a gasoline engine indoors (e.g. pressure washer, generator) -- you could expose yourself and your family to carbon monoxide.

There's absolutely no reason not to refinish and continue to use it, provided the rust isn't excessive to the point that blades are deteriorating.  Paint on some rust gel, the chemical reaction turns the rust into a stable material.  You can paint it on without removing the blades probably.  Follow directions on the gel.  You'll probably have to hose the cage off as a last step.  Then get a good quality primer in a spray can - not the cheapest, a good quality.  Spray it and get good coverage.  You could stop there, without having to add any other paint.  I'd prime it with a gray color and be done with it.  The weight from the paint will be very much negligible and won't affect the spinning action.  Also, I'd give it a good oiling, maybe even use grease vs. oil, to ensure a smooth spinning operation.  If you use grease, you may improve the operation of the cage better than when it was brand new.Good luck! <SEP> How would you preserve and paint and preserve a squirrel cage circulating fan for a furnace?

If you don't have pets indoors,  you can buy some Diazinon (sp?)at Wal Mart (it'll be in with the other bug stuff) and mix it one part Diazinon to two parts water.

Spray it in all  the cracks in your apt. and along all the floorboards and in your doorways. You can also put it around the perimeter of your apt. outside. Wait to go back in until it has dried totally (it will dry clear) and you should have no more trouble. If you do, do it again in 25- 30 days, and it should kill all eggs. Good luck!!

Look for a set of instructions that may appear on one of the panels of the heater.   They may read something like this:  (1) turn the gas dial to "Pilot".   While pressing down on the gas dial, press the red push button a few times until the pilot is lit.   (2) KEEP holding down the gas dial for about 30 seconds.  Then release it.  If the pilot light goes out, you probably need to replace your thermocouple (see below).  If it stays let, turn the gas dial to ON.  Otherwise, turn to OFF and leave the whole thing alone for 5 minutes to let any gas disapate.Replaciing a thermocouple....  This is a common home repair. (A common repair for any gas appliance with a standing pilot light.) The thermocouple is a small metal device that makes sure that there is heat where the pilot light is supposed to be. If it doesn't detect heat, it shuts off the gas valve as a safety precaution. When you are holding down the pilot knob during startup, you are essentially bypassing the thermocouple long enough to heat it up. Over time, the thermocouple degrades and dies - killing the pilot light and preventing it from staying on during an attempt to re-light it.You can call an HVAC guy and for about $100+ or so, they will stop by (after another day or two without heat) and replace this part for you. (If you rent, get your land lord to repair it!) Occasionally you will encounter a crook (they are in all lines of work) who will tell you to replace the furnace and will try to charge you $1000s.Want to try this repair yourself? Take a look at the heater and try to determine the length of the thermo-couple. Use the link below to get an idea of what it looks like and how it is connected. They come in different lengths. If you are in doubt you can error on the side of getting one a little too long. I think they are about $10-20 or so at Lowes. Truck yourself down to the hardware store and get one. Turn off the gas to your house if you feel safer (good time to learn how to do this). Usually just need an adjustable wrench at the outside gas meter.Remove the old thermocouple noting where the screws held it in place. Save the screws! You'll likely need them to install the new one. You may not need some of the parts that come with the new one. This is okay. Install the new one by screwing or snapping it into place. Turn gas back on to house. Relight your pilot light following the procedure you did before. Hold down button for at least a minute. This time the pilot light should stay on! Smell for leaks.Paranoid? Install a CO detector near your hot water heater. Keep the wrench handy for house shutoff... but if you have a leak, first get everyone out. Have never leaks and I've replaced several themocouples, furnace igniters, a gas clother dryer, gas cooktop, and even several whole hot water tanks, so take the precautions you want to, but don't be overly paranoid.You may need to re-light pilot lights of other gas appliances having turned off the house gas.This is a fairly common repair, so learning how to do this will save you a few hundred more bucks when it happens again.Good Luck. <SEP> How do I light a heater that has a push button but no pilot light?

Replace the drain valve on the bottom of the tank with a "moisture ejector".  It automatically spits a tiny amount of air / water every time the compressor motor stops.  This will eliminate water in the tank which causes the rust.  Tool stores and auto parts stores should have what you need.  The ejector needs a little plumbing to connect it to the unloader valve which is attached to the pressure regulator switch. <SEP> How can I prevent rust from happening inside my huge 120 gallon air compressor tank?

Here is an easy way. Go to the local homestore or plumbing supply store. Get a fitting that will screw onto the male garden hose thread on your outside hydrant coning out the side of your house. Then adapt the fitting to thread in a pressure gauge. Usually 100 lb. 1/4" threaded gauges work well. Screw the fitting and gauge setup on your outside hydrant and turn it on. Presto, your water pressure inside your house plumbing system! <SEP> how can you test your water Presser in your house.?
How to Unclog a ToiletUnclogging a toilet is not exactly the most entertaining way to spend a day, but it's something we all have to face at one point or another in our lives. When you're renting a place, the worst case scenerio is that you have to have maintenance come and fix your clog. But when you're a homeowner, you definitely want to avoid having a plumber come over.So, after several days of battling toilets in my house and searching the web for unique techniques, here are my three Ping-certified recommended steps to unclogging your toilet: Plunge... First, you obviously want to use your plunger to try and loosen any clogs. Start by making a seal over the hole-in-the-bowl with the plunger. Push down slowly and pull back quickly. Start by doing this at a slow pace and then working up speed. Use a toilet snake/auger... I dislike this step because it can scrape the porcelein, but it's necessary if the plunger doesn't do the job. Make sure you get a toilet snake/auger, as a sink snake/auger will scrape the porcelein on your toilet. Trust me. Work the snake as far back into the hole as possible, trying to dislodge any tissue or solid matter (mmmm... tasty). Pour a bucket of water... If the snake still doesn't let you flush the toilet successfully, this is what finally did it for me. This step can also be used before the plunger in the case of a very small clog, but works well as a last step with a stubborn clog. Get a normal sized bucket and fill it between 1/8 and 1/4 of the way full with warm water. When the water in the toilet is at its lowest point (usually with clogged toilets, very little water is left in the bottom), pour the water directly into the hole-in-the-bowl from about waist-high. The pressure of the water being poured into the bowl does a surprisingly good job at disloding the remaining clog. You may need to repeat this step once or twice. <SEP> How can I get a toilet unclogged? We have tried using a plunger and nothing it working.  It flushed but now it is just overflowing.  Thanks!

You or a mechanic will have to find a loose connection somewhere between the fuse terminal board and the lights.  Since ALL the lights are going out, I would zero in on the wiring and/or the light switch that turns them on.   The best bet on loose connections is to turn the lights on, when it is dark, and begin to wiggle wires.  IF you make them flicker, go on or off, you are close to the problem.  Don't forget to wiggle the fuse and wiring around the fuse panel also.   Good luck.  Pops <SEP> How can I fix dashboard lights that keep going out?

The best way to check the condition of the manual transmission is take out the drain plug. Be sure to catch the fluid in a clean container since you are using synthetics. The drain plug should be magnetic on the tip. If it is not, you should replace it with one that is.It serves two purposes, 1) to easily see if there is excess metal in the transmission and 2) there will all ways be some bits of metal thrown off by the gears and the magnet captures it and keeps it at the bottom of the sump so it does not act as an abrassiveto cause damage to the bearings and bushings.The clutch is a wear item and with 400 Hp you will know when the clutch is wearing thin...it will start to slip..probably in 3rd or 4th gears to begin with that much Hp and you will notice "feel" of the clutch pedal gets very narrow on engagement. <SEP> How can I tell the health of my manual transmission?

What are the symptoms?  You might just need to clean your bulb sockets.  It also depends on whether you have brake lights that operate as turn signals also or if it has completely separate turn signals.  You could just have bad bulbs.  I've seen all the bulbs go bad before anyone noticed!Some common symptoms on systems with brake and turn signals on the same bulbs:Tail light works OK but goes out when brakes are applied. Tail light will blink dimly when turn signal is used.This is a bad ground.  It could be a dirty bulb socket, or a loose ground wire.  The socket can be cleaned with a piece of sandpaper.  The ground wire will be located near the taillight assembly, bolted to the body.This system also runs the turn signals and brake lights through the turn signal switch.  A bad turn signal switch can mess up the brake lights and the turn signals.  The systems that use a separate brake light system have entirely separate circuits for brake, tail, and turn.  These systems typically have amber turn signals and red brake lights.The dirty socket or bad ground stuff still applies.If none of the lights work you probably have a wiring harness that has been damaged. <SEP> how do i fix the rear passengers tailight panel to make my tailights and brake light work?
